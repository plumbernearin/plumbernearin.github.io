<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
