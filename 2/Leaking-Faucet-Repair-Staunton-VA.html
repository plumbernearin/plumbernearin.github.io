<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair.

Copper is basic because it's long-lasting, can survive fires, and resists weather condition. However, copper is hard to install, which suggests higher labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the benefit of flexibility, which indicates plumbers can flex the pipes eliminating the need for joints, which saves time and money and reduces the danger of joint leaks. PEX likewise withstands corrosion and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which material is best depending on your needs.</p>
