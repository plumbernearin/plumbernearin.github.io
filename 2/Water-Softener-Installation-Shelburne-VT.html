<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
