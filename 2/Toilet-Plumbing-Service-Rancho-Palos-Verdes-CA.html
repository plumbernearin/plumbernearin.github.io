<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no issue in getting most of the waste through.

Another suggestion to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
