<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
