<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair specialist understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation.
