<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation in a potable water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly stream towards the point of most affordable pressure.

The need upstream could trigger a turnaround in flow.</p>
