<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Osprey FL</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
