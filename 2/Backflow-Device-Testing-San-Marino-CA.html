Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes.

If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its abilities.
