<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are badly damaged, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes 2 four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.

The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root invasion for as much as 100 years.</p>
