<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or temporary connection in between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally regrow after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>
