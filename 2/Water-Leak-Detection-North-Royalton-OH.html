These materials collect in the drain and eventually harden against the pipe walls, making them tough to eliminate. Your hot water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are one of the most common indications that your system is at the end of its life expectancy, specifically if they are triggering major flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your hot water seems rusty, this could be an indication that your hot water heater is rusting on the within and might start leaking quickly. You can examine this by filling a couple of five-gallon containers with your water.
