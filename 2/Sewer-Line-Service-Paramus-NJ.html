<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to provide years of defense. There are numerous regional conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.

<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature is maintained at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard defense assembly.</p>
