<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
