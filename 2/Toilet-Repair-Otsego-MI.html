Water pressure might be or fail minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
