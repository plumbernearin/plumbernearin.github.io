Some toilets, nevertheless, have distinctively shaped bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't an excellent concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have actually been particularly developed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or won't disperse your weight equally and could eventually trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
