<p>Downsides to be familiar with is that hybrid hot water heater need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
