<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite direction. You have irreversible water solidity if you do not see limescale accumulation but rather see soap scum, your washing detergents not working as effectively or your skin getting itchy and sensitive. Do not try to find the leak if you smell gas. Rather, leave your house or structure right now. Do not switch on or off any electrical switches, home appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge might create a spark. When you are in a safe place, call the Peoples emergency hotline.</p>
