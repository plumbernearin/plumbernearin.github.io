<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
