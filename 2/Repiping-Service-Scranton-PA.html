<p>No, you must NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be far more destructive than valuable, potentially gnawing at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's entire plumbing system, consisting of both water supply and drain lines.

<p>To determine if your home is a poly house," start with the exterior. Underground water pipe are normally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is attached to the end of the water main. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can happen when there is an unexpected decrease in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as throughout fire battling or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This reversal can produce a suction impact and draw possible pollutants into the safe and clean (drinking) water system. Storage tank water heaters are frequently discovered in many homes. Their elements are an insulated tank, usually holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water up until it's needed. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver hot water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>

<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a service of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than items containing extreme chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with known backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and hot tubs. Rotate the disposal unit to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that link it. Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Tip: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and examine the flange and drain for leaks. Backflow - Do you discover water reappearing in your sink or shower? This could indicate that the water doesn't have a clear course to do through, more than likely due to the fact that of a blocked drain.
