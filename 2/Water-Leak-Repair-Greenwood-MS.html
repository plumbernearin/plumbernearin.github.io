Sediment Accumulation: If you observe weird popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is causing a response with the heating component. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment build-up, because the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Dual Checks. There are 2 other kinds of backflow preventers available that you might encounter. The very first is a check valve. The second is a double check".
