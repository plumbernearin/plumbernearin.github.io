<p>Unusual Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely requires an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to pass through. The pipes typically make weird gurgling sounds as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight area. This triggers the water to bubble, as just small pockets of air are available, resulting in the odd noises emanating from your sink.</p>
