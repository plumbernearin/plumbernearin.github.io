<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

If you have hard water, your hair might feel dull and do not have body, and your clothing will start to fade and may break previously.
