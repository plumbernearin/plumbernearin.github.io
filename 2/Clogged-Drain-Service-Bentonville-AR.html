<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
