<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>There can be a variety of reasons you home or organisation is experiencing sewer problems. If your toilets are flushing slowly, you're experiencing consistent sewer backups, or notice a foul or odd odor is originating from your drains, it could be an indication that it is time to call experts to completely inspect your drains and solve your sewer problems.</p>
