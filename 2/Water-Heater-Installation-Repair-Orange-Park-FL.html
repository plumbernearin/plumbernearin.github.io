<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>
<p>Each element of the assembly should be checked to determine what requires repair. The field test may not always reveal you the intensity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the standard rubber repair kit are required. There may be extra test treatments, beyond those developed in the tester accreditation program, that can supply data revealing the seriousness of the failure that could assist in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>
