<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a viable service, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they normally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
