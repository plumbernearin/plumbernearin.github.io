<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to prevent winter season freezing. The new pipe, made from a state-of-the-art, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls.

<p>Tankless Water Heaters - supply hot water as needed without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring warm water triggers the heater and water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Due to the fact that they can restrain the blades, cooking oil and other greases should never ever be put down the garbage disposal. Finally, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and should continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to ensure that all food particles have actually been rinsed through the pipes.</p>
