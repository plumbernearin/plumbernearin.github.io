<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This corrosion can cause a buildup of lead, which can have many negative effects on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
