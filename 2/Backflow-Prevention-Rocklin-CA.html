<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow of water which may bring unclean water or other, dangerous compounds into the general public water supply and personal plumbing. Backflow can happen in a variety of scenarios that may draw water from places such as garden fountains, swimming pools, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water system lines. Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing if it is connected to any outside water source. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to determine water sources and scenarios that need backflow prevention devices. For house, it is important for owners to signal the District if any changes are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial home, the District evaluates using each new tenant. The correction needs to be made before water service is allowed if the existing backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the renter or the property owner.</p>

Based upon the condition of the line, it may be an appropriate choice to do just that. Nevertheless, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be an alternative.</p>
