<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap develops down the drain due to the fact that they generally include grease and fat. When the fat of the soap combines with mineral water, it forms a solid residue and sticks to the pipes, obstructing them. Call and schedule a follow up inspection by an EBMUD Backflow Inspector to confirm that assembly is properly set up. The toilet is the most made use of plumbing fixture in your house. The regular usage of your toilet means that plumbing problems will need your timely attention. We provide professional Jacksonville Toilet Repair and Replacement services, and are on call when you need us.</p>
