<p>Sewer lines have one crucial function: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. Many folks replace their hot water heater due to bad efficiency, total failure or as a preventive procedure. If your hot water heater is more than ten years old, it's time to consider changing it with a more effective model. Water on the floor can mean worn parts.
