<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to obstructions that stem inside the house. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also referred to as tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, plastic, copper or clay, will figure out the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
