<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a necessity more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
