<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to supply years of security. There are lots of regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water turbidity, quality or temperature level can all cause the assembly to deteriorate in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies may hardly ever need repair while some are repaired regularly. The test data from the field test will determine the repair frequency.</p>

<p>Once the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut down stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>
