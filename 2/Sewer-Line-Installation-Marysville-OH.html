<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a necessity more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
