<p>Very seldom does any structural damage happen as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is generally identified before it causes any considerable damage. The water leak is normally the size of a pinhole. This small hole enables water to continuously leak out extremely gradually. Over time it can result in a significant build of water. Dripped water typically stays under the house and fills into the ground soil. If the house's structure was not properly compressed, this can potentially cause a cavity. This is an uncommon occasion and in basic, there is little concern over structural damage as the outcome of a slab leak.</p>
