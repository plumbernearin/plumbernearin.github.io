Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
