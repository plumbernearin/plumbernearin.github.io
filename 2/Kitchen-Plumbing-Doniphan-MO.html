A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe.

<p>One typical way for a house's supply of water to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which might become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the issue might spread out exponentially. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in individual homes, it also avoids wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and polluting the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a personal water system exceeds the pressure in the public water distribution lines that can cause normal flow to reverse, backpressure occurs. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a higher floor might trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be performed on all drains, consisting of toilet, tub, sink and floor drains.</p>
