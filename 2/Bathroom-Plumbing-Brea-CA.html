Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no chance to provide one, then we examine to see that the correct BFP device is installed.

<p>Many softeners have a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to provide some type of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it.
