<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
