Clean with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on.

<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in very uncommon cases where the building is deemed to not pose a risk to the water supply, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
