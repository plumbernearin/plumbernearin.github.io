<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Sheboygan WI 53081?</h3>
<p>If you've always resided in an area with tough water, you may not recognize how much it affects you-- but if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too familiar with the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from hard water. Difficult water hinders the lathering of shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Tough water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can take place in time from the accumulation of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes. As a clog becomes larger gradually, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes appropriately. You can combat tough water in various ways, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, including a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
