Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>When used in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firemen by and large are not interested in backflow prevention problems. They are concerning with securing people's lives and to a lesser level their property. Getting the essential volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will utilize water from any source offered to accomplish that goal. This can produce cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome suggest that the level of security on the fire security system may need to be increased to a high danger defense level.</p>
