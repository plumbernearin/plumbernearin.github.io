<p>Backflow preventers are a fairly easy system, despite their value. Most of commercial use backflow prevention setups utilize a valve system that gets in touch with the irrigation line within your business, where watering satisfies the main supply of water. From here, the preventer can keep an eye on the movement of water within your system, and avoid any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be caused by malfunctioning plumbing devices.
