He was then able to get rid of the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet component. The customer helped our service technician in moving the toilet back into its appropriate location, and the technician tightened up the bolts prior to restoring the supply of water and making sure that the toilet was effectively flushing.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
