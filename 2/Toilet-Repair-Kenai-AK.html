<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can deteriorate or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour.
