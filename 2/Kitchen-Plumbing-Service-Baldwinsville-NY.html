<p>The very best way to handle high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities site is by installing a pressure reducing valve (PRV). A PRV will regulate water pressure as it enters the home. According to San Diego public utilities, a PRV can also help to save water as components in the house will utilize less water when the pressure is at a lower and more workable PSI.</p>
<p>As soon as installed, these BPAs go through periodic and initial testing and maintenance requirements to confirm their continued functional effectiveness. Such testing must be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific information is also readily available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Details ).</p>
