<p>If you observe low water pressure or tarnished water, it usually represents rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up in time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can end up being a health danger in your water.</p>
