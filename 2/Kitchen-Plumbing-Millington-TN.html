The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For numerous installs, expenses vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Drip legs capture wetness so that it doesn't get in the control system. Although small pieces of sediment may survive a drip leg.</p>
<p>Lots of homeowner install gas lines for gas stoves, heating systems, fireplaces or other gas operable devices in the house. Gas lines deliver the natural energy source to the house securely.

<p>Installation and replacement costs are often similar, though replacement usually will not need service charges, such as application costs.

<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next step would be to remove the P-trap under the sink.
