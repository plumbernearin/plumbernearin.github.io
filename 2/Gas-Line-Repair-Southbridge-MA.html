<p>Installation and replacement costs are often similar, though replacement usually will not need surcharges, such as application charges. New meters need to fulfill guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas service providers may need a distinct meter for their services, restricting your options. Layout - Once you include a 2nd floor and even 3rd floor, pipes need to be run up to it. This is more intricate than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor intensive. Plumbing services will utilize more products which adds to your labor costs.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable safety measures.</p>
