<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process.

As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
