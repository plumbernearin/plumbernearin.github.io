<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
