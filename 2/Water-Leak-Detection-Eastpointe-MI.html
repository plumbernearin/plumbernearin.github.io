These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
