<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
