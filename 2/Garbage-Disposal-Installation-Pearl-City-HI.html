(Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To prevent this, make sure the new garbage disposal installation kit consists of a tube, or buy one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company provides consist of check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel models), and decreased pressure zone assemblies.

When you connect the P-trap, likewise attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet.</p>
