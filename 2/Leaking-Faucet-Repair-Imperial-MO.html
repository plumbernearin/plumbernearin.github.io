<p>House owners often ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient. The answer depends on your home.

<p>Depending on your water quality, some softeners may be able to completely or partly get rid of copper, radium, manganese, and iron, in addition to calcium and magnesium. Keep in mind that copper can reenter the water after if passes and leaves the softener through your home's pipes and plumbing. These softeners might have special filter media and may cost more than normal softeners. Before using a softener for this purpose, follow the suggestions listed in your home Water Treatment.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity.

Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
