<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
