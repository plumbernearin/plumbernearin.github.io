From a health standpoint, these minerals have no unfavorable results and are, in fact, essential daily nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the rejuvenating taste many people discover desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surface areas, perhaps plug pipes and damage water heaters, and reduce the efficiency of cleaning agents and soaps. At this point the water is said to be difficult.</p>
