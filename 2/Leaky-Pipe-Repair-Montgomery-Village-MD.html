<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
