<p>Homeowners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, but it is especially prudent to organize inspections on a yearly basis and when buying a new home. Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the baking soda and vinegar mix, an enzyme treatment will also keep pipes running smoothly. Enzymes are germs that eat organic matter, such as hair, mold, algae and other common clog-causers. This natural option is safe and efficient. Contact us today at High 5 Plumbing to purchase our advised enzyme cleaner, Bioclean.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates professional inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your property. The camera is by hand controlled on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light offers a clear image for the specialist to properly examine conditions and detect the performance of the pipes. The info we glean from the inspection enables us to make a notified decision concerning the condition of your pipes and advise the best solution as well. If the pipe needs to be cleaned up of clogs or relined with epoxy resin, we can make the ideal suggestion with confidence.</p>

<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Solid Clogs: Professional support is the very best treatment, if you discover yourself provided with a specifically stubborn clog. You might wind up doing more damage than excellent if you continue to combat with it, which can develop permanent problems. Sewage back-flow is another significant concern if you do not have a professional look into your clog scenario.</p>
