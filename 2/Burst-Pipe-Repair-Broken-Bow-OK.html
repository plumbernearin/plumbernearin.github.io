Residences built in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no idea that the lead in the pipes could leach into the drinking water, let alone the health dangers associated with lead.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently listen and raise the rod. If the water shuts down, you may have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed effectively (Photo 8). You do not need to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
