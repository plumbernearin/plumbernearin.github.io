<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this technique, you know the turnkey rate entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first shot utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the suitable safety measures.</p>
