<p>Set up 50 gallon electrical water heater and thermal growth tank. When your drains are clogged, you will probably start to observe gurgling noises, water supporting into your sink or shower, or weird smells. Drain blockages are caused by wear and tear or a build-up of things we put down the drain gradually and as we know, they can cause serious plumbing problems.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
