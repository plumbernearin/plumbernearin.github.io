<h3>Discover The World Of Faucets For Improved Water Conservation Durham NH</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
