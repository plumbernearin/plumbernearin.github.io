<p>Release piping connected to a hygienic sewer shall be caught and geared up with a backwater check valve. Jafco finished a repair on the sewer line at my rental home in Edmonds. The job was finished quickly and professionally. I would hire them again.

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>EcoWater's elite water softener system is our conditioner, readily available in a single-tank "cabinet" style. It is highly advised for either local or well water products.

For commercial property, the District reviews the use of each brand-new tenant. The correction must be made before water service is allowed if the current backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the home or the occupant owner.</p>
