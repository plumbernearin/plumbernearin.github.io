<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see however rarely stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace just a single section of pipe to save money. While this might work in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the exact same material as other pipes in your home, implying that trouble might be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you comfort and prevent bigger leaks down the roadway.</p>
