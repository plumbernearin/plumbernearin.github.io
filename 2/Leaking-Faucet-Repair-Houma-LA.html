<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
