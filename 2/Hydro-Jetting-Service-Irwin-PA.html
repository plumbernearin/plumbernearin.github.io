<p>When you remove the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is inexpensive and simple. But discovering the best washer might not be. The most common washers are often readily available in your home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be hard to find. Eliminate it and take it to the store to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
