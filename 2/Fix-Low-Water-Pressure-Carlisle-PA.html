Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>
