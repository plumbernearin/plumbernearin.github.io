<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners get rid of calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Basically, soft water saves you cash. Minimized Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and listed below the first check valve.</p>
