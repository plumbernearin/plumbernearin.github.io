<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Toilets are challenging things to know. They've been constructed pretty much the exact same way for hundreds of years, so you can't really tell how old they are.

Plus, there's that never ever unacknowledged but universal sensation that it's you-you're somehow doing something wrong in there.</p>
