<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and get rid of water molecules from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is free of hardness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for the majority of fire security systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or particles in the water line avoids them from closing entirely, backflow can occur.</p>
