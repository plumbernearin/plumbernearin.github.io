Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to detect.</p>
