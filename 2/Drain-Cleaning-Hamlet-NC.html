<h3>Sewer Drain in Hamlet North Carolina</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
