As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there need to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you should probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
