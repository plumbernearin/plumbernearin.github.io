From here, the preventer can monitor the motion of water within your system, and avoid any possible back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be caused by malfunctioning plumbing equipment. This guarantees that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other watering and wastewater systems stays disconnected from clean" water.</p>
