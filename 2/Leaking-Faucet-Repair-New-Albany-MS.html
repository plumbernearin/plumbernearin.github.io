<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Service in New Albany</h2>

<p>As a locally-owned service, integrity and duty are extremely essential to building a track record for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the safe and clean water system within a building these gadgets are referred to as isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to provide one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
