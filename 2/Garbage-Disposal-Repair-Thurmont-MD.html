<p>Many house owners think their energy companies or property owners insurance is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the reality is that in many cases you, the house owner, are responsible. Most basic homeowners insurance policies and local energy companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems in and around your house.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for carrying out annual forward circulation tests are sometimes viewed as a mandate to have them.
