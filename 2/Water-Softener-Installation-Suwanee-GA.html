<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there should be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you need to probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

<p>If you see nothing apparent, insert the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the system, and twist ideal and left. Inspect that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and then try the reset button if the motor spins easily.

<p>Strainers are advised prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire fighting water lines. No strainer is to be used in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance coverage Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.
