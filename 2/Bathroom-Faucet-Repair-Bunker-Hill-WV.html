<p>Supply of water by the public utility consists of some amounts of hazardous chemicals like arsenic and lead.

<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>While pipe lining is an excellent alternative for most people, there are some scenarios where repiping is the only option. Repiping is the procedure of changing old corroded pipes with durable and lasting new pipes. The new pipes that are used are generally made of copper since of their durability and other factors. Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
