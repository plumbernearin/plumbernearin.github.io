<p>It is not always due to blockages that stem inside the house when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently installed, such as cast iron, copper, plastic or clay, will figure out the extent of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to present a chemical compound that functions as a chelating agent.

<p>You reside in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to rust and burst when they get old.
