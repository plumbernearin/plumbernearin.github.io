<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and pricey plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can cause corrosion that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and takes away from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
