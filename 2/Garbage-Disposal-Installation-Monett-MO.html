<h3>Gas Line Replacement in Monett Missouri</h2>
<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
