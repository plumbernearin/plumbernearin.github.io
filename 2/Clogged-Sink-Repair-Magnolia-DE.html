<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and complex plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and area of the pipe, it was a hard task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
<p>Each part of the assembly must be evaluated to determine what needs repair. The field test might not always reveal you the intensity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the standard rubber repair set are required.
