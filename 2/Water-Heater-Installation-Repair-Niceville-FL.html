If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
