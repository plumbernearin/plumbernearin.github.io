Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
