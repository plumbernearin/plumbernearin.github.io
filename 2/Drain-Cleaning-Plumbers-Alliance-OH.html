Use an option of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work better than products containing severe chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or components.</p>
