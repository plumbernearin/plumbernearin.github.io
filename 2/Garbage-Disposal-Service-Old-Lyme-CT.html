<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a feasible service, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many downsides to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
