<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you do not get that chance. In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in joists, studs, and floors. Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat dealing with a shoddy plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the job with insurance claims, lost time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
