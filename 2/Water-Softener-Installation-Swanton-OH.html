Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
