<p>It's challenging to identify if you have cracked or broken drains until a video inspection is carried out. Split or broken drains are typically preceded by recurring blockages, constant foul drain odors or the existence of sewer flies.

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently raise the rod and listen. If the water shuts off, you may be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted correctly (Image 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
