If your set only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.

Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair service technician knows the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
