<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
