<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank runs out of salt, the water going through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
