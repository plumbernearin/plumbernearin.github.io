<p>To determine if your house is a poly home," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it enters the house near the hot water heater. Your main turned off is attached to the end of the water main. Ensure you check both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>

Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet.
