<p>Property owners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is particularly sensible to arrange inspections on a yearly basis and when buying a new house.

As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible amount, there should be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you should probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils.
