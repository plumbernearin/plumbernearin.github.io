<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

It is estimated that a typical household can save as much as $100 each year by switching to the tankless heater.</p>

Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been just recently used and you've replaced the flapper, the issue might be larger than it appears. The tank ultimately loses its ability to seal effectively, developing waste and a higher water expense.</p>
