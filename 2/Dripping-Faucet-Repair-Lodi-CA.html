<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>You need to spend at least $50 to get a high-quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a long lasting surface and a reliable stopper system. The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can use, but screwing it in and out can be annoying. The twist-and-drop design is much easier to utilize but requires periodic -ring replacement.</p>
