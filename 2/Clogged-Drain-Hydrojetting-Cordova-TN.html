The size of the pipes must be proportional to the size of the home appliance being installed.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be offered to the City of Bellingham.
