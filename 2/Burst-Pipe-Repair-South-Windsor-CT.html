<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
