<p>The U-shaped pipe below bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that individuals expect to see but seldom stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck.

The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
