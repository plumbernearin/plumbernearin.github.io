<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a feasible solution, especially when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and household.</p>
