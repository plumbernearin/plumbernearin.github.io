<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if needed, to place television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store. To avoid this, make sure the brand-new garbage disposal installation package consists of a tube, or buy one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
