<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
