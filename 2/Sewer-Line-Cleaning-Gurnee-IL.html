<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
