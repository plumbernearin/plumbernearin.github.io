<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Detroit MI</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>CALL Nicor Gas at 888. Nicor4U (888.642.6748) and emergency responders at 911 as soon as you are in a safe location, far from the area of the presumed leak. Stay away until emergency workers show it is safe to return.
