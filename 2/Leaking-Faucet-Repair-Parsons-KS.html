Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed.
