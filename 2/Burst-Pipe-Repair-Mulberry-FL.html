<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less easily. Water softening can prevent these negative impacts. Gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a safety preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that provides gas a smell often associated with rotten eggs. This distinctive aroma permits you to smell a possible leak if it occurs. If you believe a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>All of these issues are typical and easy to deal with when managed early. By calling Bell Cow at (844) 234-2355 upon very first observing an issue, you can prevent more major problems triggered by leaks, like structural damage. Do not get milked by your water bill either!
