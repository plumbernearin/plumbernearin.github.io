It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position.

When these parts wear, they lead to small leakages that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part.
