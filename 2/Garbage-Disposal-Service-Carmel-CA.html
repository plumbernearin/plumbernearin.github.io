<h3>Need A Plumber Service Carmel CA</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are thought about safe for many fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing entirely, backflow can happen.</p>
