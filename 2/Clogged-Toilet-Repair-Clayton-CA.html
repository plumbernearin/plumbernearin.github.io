<h3>Broken Pipe in Clayton California</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
