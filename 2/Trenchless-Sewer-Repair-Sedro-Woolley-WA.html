<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.
