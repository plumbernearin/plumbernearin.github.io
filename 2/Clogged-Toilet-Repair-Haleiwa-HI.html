Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
