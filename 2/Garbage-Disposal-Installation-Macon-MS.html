<p>The very best way to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities site is by setting up a pressure lowering valve (PRV).

While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
