When drains are working effectively that's actually all you need to know about them, but when something goes wrong, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what kinds of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage.

<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, waste disposal unit do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
