<h3>The Importance Of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Gladstone MI 49837</h3>

Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
