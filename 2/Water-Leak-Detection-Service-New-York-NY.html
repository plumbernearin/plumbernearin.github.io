<p>You probably understand something about your drains: they take water from your showers, bathtubs, and sinks to a local water treatment center. When drains are working appropriately that's actually all you need to know about them, however when something fails, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what sort of problems can occur in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the proficiency to diagnose an issue and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make certain to take the appropriate precautions if utilizing one of these items.</p>
