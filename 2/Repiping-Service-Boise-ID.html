<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible option, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>
