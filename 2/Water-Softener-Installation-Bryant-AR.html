<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

The direct exposure to carbon monoxide is so deadly that anybody who inhales it needs instant medical attention. The Centers for Illness Control and Prevention exposed that 5149 individuals passed away from carbon monoxide gas poisoning between 1999 and 2010.
