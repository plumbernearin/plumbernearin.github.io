<p>While city water does get treated, it is provided for purposes of removing bacterial issues and making the water drinkable.

<p>Every water heater we install has been tested under the most extreme water temperatures and was built to last a long time. When your existing water heater starts failing, a new installation may cost money in advance, however it can conserve you hundreds and even thousands of dollars in the long run.

That's why citizens of Centreville, Fairfax, Herndon, Reston, Leesburg, and other parts of Northern Virginia have actually been using Service Specialties for hot water heater installations for almost 40 years now. Our local plumbing contractors are happy to work with you to come up with the ideal water heater system for your house or organisation.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
