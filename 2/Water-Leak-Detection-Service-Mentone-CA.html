<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
