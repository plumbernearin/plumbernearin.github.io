Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>As soon as per year to clean out the drains and keep whatever running smoothly, we suggest that homeowners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least.
