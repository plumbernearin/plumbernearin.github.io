<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>We recommend that house owners buy cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber a minimum of once per year to clean out the drains and keep whatever running smoothly.
