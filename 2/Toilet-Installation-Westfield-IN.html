<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat wall mount by straightening it. Obviously, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some blockages.

Whether you need help with a minor repair, a remodel or a re-pipe, you can make sure that the work will be completed the first time properly. Low water pressure might be due to a multitude of elements, however the most common factors are sediment buildup and rust, which both obstruct water from passing through the entire pipe and put unnecessary pressure on specific sections of pipe.</p>
<p>Pieces that comprise kitchen sink drains can become worn and corroded, leading to leakages. Depending on the seriousness of the situation, just one piece may need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly must be gotten rid of and changed. Parts involved consist of slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Poorly installed P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not secured by nut joints and washers, should be reconfigured.</p>
