<p>Agilent's range of leak detection solutions ensure the safety, security and consistent performance of research study, vacuum, and commercial procedure systems. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This procedure includes covering Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to prevent leaks and deterioration within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier in between the inside of the material and the pipe streaming through it. This repair technique is preferable for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I have actually contacted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
