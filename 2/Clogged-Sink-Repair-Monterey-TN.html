<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting is a problem. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I run into situations, quite often that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the task. Often, the basements are so full of sewage, I can not safely get in the basement and operate up until the sewage is drawn out and the basement is normally cleaned. I 'd enjoy to post some photos of this. Simply search line. The problem does exist.</p>
