<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant costs can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for homeowners. A PE or RA can help figure out if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
