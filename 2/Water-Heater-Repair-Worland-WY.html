<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is comprised of six State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, one of which is likewise acts as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Plan Inspector for the group. Toilets save lives. It might sound crazy, but it holds true. Correct sanitation in the type of working toilets and properly maintained sewer system assists prevent potentially lethal illness from attacking you and your family. In the United States we are extremely lucky that the majority of us never ever have to stress over catching such health problems, but it is still essential to keep our toilets clean and in great operating condition to prevent the potential for illness to our families - in addition to saving ourselves the basic inconvenience and high cost of toilet problems left unattended for too long.

<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this accreditation. I've contacted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
