I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing License and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties.
