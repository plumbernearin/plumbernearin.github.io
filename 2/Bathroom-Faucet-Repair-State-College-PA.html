<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber State College PA</h3>
<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less easily. Water softening can prevent these negative results. Natural gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a security preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives natural gas a smell often associated with rotten eggs. If it takes place, this unique aroma allows you to smell a prospective leak. Constantly leave if you presume a leak.</p>
