<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair technician knows the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and get rid of water molecules from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is free of hardness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
