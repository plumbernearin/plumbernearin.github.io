A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building needs a backflow preventer or numerous devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in very uncommon cases where the building is deemed to not posture a threat to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
