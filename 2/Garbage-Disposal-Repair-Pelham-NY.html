Transplant these plants, if possible, to keep roots far from your plumbing. Underground pipes can be costly to repair or replace.</p>
<p>Natural gas is difficult to identify, as it's a colorless, odor free compound. We use gas in our homes with gas heaters, ovens, and stoves. American homes gain access to natural gas through miles and miles of underground pipelines. Having a natural gas leak from an outdoor pipeline and indoor devices can take place rapidly and all of a sudden.
