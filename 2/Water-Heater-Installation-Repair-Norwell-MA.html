<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it as well.</p>

To prevent corrosion from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by drawing in harmful products.
