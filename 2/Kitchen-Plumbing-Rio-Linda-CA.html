<p>We will conduct an extensive inspection of your house's pipes in order to figure out which service will be the best fit. Whether you pick repiping or pipe lining it can be an intimidating decision and process, however we will be with you the whole way through. The typical cost to reroute a gas or move line is in between $15 and $25 per direct foot. Contributing factors to the final price consist of the piping, range, and conditions.
