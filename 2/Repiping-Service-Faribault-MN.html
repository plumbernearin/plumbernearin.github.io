Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
