Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
