<p>Leak detection belongs of water preservation that relies on extremely technical knowledge and specific devices to determine the place of leaks throughout the city's water distribution system and identify the location of those leakages at which visible water may or may not have appeared.

<p>Another distinction between hard and soft water is dullness of your hair and clothes.
