<p>Backflow preventers are a reasonably simple system, in spite of their significance. The majority of commercial usage backflow prevention setups use a valve system that gets in touch with the watering line within your service, where watering fulfills the main supply of water. From here, the preventer can keep an eye on the movement of water within your system, and avoid any prospective back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be caused by malfunctioning plumbing equipment.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
