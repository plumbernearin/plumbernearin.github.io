<p>We have an inspection program to identify water sources and circumstances that require backflow prevention gadgets. For residential property, it is important for owners to alert the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a brand-new well.

<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
