<p>We offer emergency drain repair services for split and breached drain lines that will help you to avoid possibly bigger problems in the future. Leaky and broke drains waste water that ends up costing you cash as well as damaging the environment. Stopping these leaks and fixing broken pipes is specifically essential in an area as drought-stricken as Los Angeles where summertime water allocations are low, and costs are high.</p>

<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this approach, you know the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
