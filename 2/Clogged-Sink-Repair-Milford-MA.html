<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the major offenders. If fats are put down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls too. Even tree roots can produce major drain obstructions by wrapping around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the problem for regular house plumbing operations. If this is what is taking place to your home, you need your drain cleaned up before it causes more damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
