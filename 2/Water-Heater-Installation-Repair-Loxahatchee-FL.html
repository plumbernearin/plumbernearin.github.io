<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to rust and burst when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>

When this happens you need a plumbing company that can arrive quickly. Determine the full magnitude of the issue, and fix it fast.</p>
