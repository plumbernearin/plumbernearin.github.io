<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
