<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the defective pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing.

<h3>Gas Dryer Hook Up in East Haven Connecticut</h2>
