<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair service technician knows the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
