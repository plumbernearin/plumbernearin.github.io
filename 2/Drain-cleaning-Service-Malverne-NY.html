<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it might need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
