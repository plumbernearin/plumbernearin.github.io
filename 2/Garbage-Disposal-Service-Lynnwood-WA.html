The beads accelerate the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely eliminate momentary solidity in water.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the offender. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause trouble too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
