Repiping is the process of replacing old rusty pipes with lasting and durable brand-new pipes. Since of their sturdiness and other elements, the new pipes that are used are usually made of copper. Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
