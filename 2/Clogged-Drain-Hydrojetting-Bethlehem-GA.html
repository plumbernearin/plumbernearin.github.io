<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally maintained at a considerable pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may be or stop working decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
