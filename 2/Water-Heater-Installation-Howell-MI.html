<p>Depending upon what part of the world you're from you may have heard sink disposals referred to as waste disposal unit," food waste disposers," or, if you're really correct, a sink waste disposal unit."

<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

The outdoor gas meter ought to be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is easily accessible in an emergency.</p>
