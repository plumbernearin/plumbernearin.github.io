Exemptions, which are given in incredibly rare cases where the building is considered to not pose a threat to the water system, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
