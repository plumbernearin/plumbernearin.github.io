<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each element. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or constant) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>

<p>When the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized.

Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital areas in the assembly.

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
