It is necessary that the repair professional knows the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
