<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
