<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the potable system providing the makeup water. This can require the potable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the two systems. Prospective pollutants can then get in the potable water system.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Was your home constructed prior to the 1970s and has not gone through renovation or pipe replacement? It is most likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another material which has corroded and decayed over the years if so.
