<p>If you observe low water pressure or discolored water, it normally represents rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop in time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may see lower water pressure. The discoloration happens when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your water system, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health risk in your water.</p>
<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions except straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the appliance. Each place where you will have a gas device should have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, any person who sets up gas piping on home not under their ownership need to possess a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping installations need an authorization and inspection.</p>
