<p>The source or area of a sewer issue identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool producer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done independently. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as 2 hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
