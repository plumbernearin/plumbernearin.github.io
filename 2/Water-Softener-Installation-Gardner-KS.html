Products that would otherwise enter the garbage must not be put in your disposal. This consists of glass, plastic, metals (yes, flatware), paper, anything flammable, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>

A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in individual houses, it likewise avoids wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and contaminating the public water supply.</p>
