<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
