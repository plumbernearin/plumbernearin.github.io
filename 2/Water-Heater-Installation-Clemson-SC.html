<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
