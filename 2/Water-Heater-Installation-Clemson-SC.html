<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from flowing back to the City system. Backflow can pollute the water system.

All leaks, worn out fittings, and other plumbing problems will be fixed.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a vital part of your house or organisation, and its capability to function is vital. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains clogging, this could be an indication of a bigger problem, like a tree root invasion or a large clog.

Small blockages can develop into huge ones relatively rapidly.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
