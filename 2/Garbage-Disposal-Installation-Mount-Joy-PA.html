<p>Old, worn, or damaged plumbing pipes can trigger significant problems. Even little leakages can slowly dampen walls and floorings up until they end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes may end up being corroded and add rust to the water supply. Gurgling noise from pipes. A strange, gurgling noise coming from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never a great indication. Possibilities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not suffice to resolve this concern. Call a plumber immediately.</p>
<p>Was your home built prior to the 1970s and has not gone through renovation or pipe replacement?
