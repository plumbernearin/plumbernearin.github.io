<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
