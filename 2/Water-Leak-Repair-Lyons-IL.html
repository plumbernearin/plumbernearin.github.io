<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair specialist knows the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in locations where the ambient temperature level is maintained at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In circumstances where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little packing dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high risk security assembly.</p>
