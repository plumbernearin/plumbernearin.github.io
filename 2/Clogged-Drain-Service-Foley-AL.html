When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>If your sewer line is clogged or you suspect it of being damaged, a digital camera inspection of the pipe is one of the very best tools for identifying both the cause of the issue, and the location of the problem.
