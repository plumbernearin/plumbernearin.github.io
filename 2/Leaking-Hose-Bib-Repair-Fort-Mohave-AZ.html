<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Fort Mohave AZ</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had great reviews and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task cleaning up after it too.</p>
