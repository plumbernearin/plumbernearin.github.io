<p>Hydro jetting is one of numerous trenchless services readily available to you, available by means of North Georgia Inliner. Hydro jetting is the use of hot, highly pressurized water through a protected hose and nozzle to clear any and all obstructions. This procedure is a little more environment-friendly than snaking because it just uses water, which your pipes are used to managing. It also saves you money and time because a 2nd inspection isn't essential.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next step would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail beneath the area to catch water then loosen the two threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in location. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
