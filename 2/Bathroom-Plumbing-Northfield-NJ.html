<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which triggers the solidity ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 should be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.

<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or irreversible connection in between a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or consumer's potable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. Due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally restore after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water utilize schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
