<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>

<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
