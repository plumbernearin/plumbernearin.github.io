<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this method, you know the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>It assists to understand the brand and model of your toilet. The brand is usually on the bowl behind the seat.

Even professional plumbers in some cases try 2 or 3 flappers prior to they find one that works well.</p>
