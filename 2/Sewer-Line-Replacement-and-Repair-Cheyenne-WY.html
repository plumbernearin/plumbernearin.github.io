How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced right now. Before you can ask for an inspection, you must initially get the required authorization( s) for the work you plan to do. You can check out our Permit page to learn more on obtaining a permit.
