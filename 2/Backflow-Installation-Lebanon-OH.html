<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent guy. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as assured. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently listen and lift the rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's adjusted correctly (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, waste disposal unit do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
