Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an exceptionally pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
