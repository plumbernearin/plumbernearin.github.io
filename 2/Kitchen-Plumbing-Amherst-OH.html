If you wish to put new pipes in your house or you're constructing a house, there are three kinds of brand-new plumbing pipe offered that are building-code authorized for houses-- copper, PEX, and CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride). PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are exceptional alternatives to the expensive copper piping.</p>
