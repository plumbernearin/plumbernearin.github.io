<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would normally cause rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately end up being worn out and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your water heater really quickly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>

Also, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
