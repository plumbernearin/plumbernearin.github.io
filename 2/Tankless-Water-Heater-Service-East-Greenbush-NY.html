Toilet leaks around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>A lot of normal single household house systems won't need supply piping larger than 3‚ÅÑ4 inch (19 mm) due to cost in addition to steel piping's propensity to end up being obstructed from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe with time once the internal galvanizing zinc finish has actually deteriorated. In potable water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographical areas with destructive water pollutants.</p>

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
