<p>Unusual Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely requires a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to go through.

This causes the water to bubble, as just small pockets of air are available, resulting in the odd sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can happen gradually from the accumulation of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes. As a clog becomes bigger with time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining properly. You can combat hard water in numerous ways, consisting of filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
