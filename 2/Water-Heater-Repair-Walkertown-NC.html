<p>One common way for a house's water supply to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue might spread out significantly if that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in private houses, it likewise prevents wastewater in personal homes from receding out and infecting the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
