<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
