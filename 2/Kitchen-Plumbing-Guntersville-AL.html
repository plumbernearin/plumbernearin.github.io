<p>You reside in an older home. There's an excellent chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to corrode and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>With PVC you have a couple of options if your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering a stoppage. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. If the line is about 40 years old and is showing signs of age throughout, certainly replace. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable choice to do just that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless may no longer be a choice.</p>
