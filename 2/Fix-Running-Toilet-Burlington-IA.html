<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the proper preventative measures.</p>
