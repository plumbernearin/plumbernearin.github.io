<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but hardly ever stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
