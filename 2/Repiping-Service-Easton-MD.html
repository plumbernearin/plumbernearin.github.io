Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be heated up and offered for use. Also, corrosion of the tank's aspects can cause the tank to have a brief life. Request that a brand-new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of rust.</p>
