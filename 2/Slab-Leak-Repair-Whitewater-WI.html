<p>If a cable has not yet been run to the junction box, you can make the connections within the brand-new disposer at any time beforehand, joining the cable to the wires in package right before or simply after mounting the disposer. Garbage disposals are quite simple to preserve. The most essential thing to bear in mind is that they are truly food disposals.
