<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer system calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regeneration generally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to blockages with food and grease being the significant offenders. They harden to the piping walls if fats are put down the sink.
