<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping.

Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank.
