Like any home appliance, a toilet tank features many small moving parts that may need replaced with use over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and trigger toilet leakages that aren't clearly noticeable to the naked eye.

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
