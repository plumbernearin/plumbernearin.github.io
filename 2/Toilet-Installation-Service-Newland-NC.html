<p>Backflow Preventers are an important part of any plumbing project with the function of keeping drinkable water different from any potential dangers through various applications. We provide a variety of kinds of Backflow Preventers, including Minimized Pressure Zone (RPZ) Assemblies, Vacuum Breakers, Dual Checks, and Check Valve Assemblies, in addition to accompanying test valves, enclosures, and packages.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
