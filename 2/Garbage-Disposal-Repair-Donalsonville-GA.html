<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Donalsonville GA 39845</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>Hot water is no longer a high-end-- it's a necessity.
