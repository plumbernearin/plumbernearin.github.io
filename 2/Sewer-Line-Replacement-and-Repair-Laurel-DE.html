<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
