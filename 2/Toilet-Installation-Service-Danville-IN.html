<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that assist avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the firmness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement.
