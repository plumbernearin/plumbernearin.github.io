<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
