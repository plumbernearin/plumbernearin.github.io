It is very important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively working RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water.

Sufficient drainage needs to also be supplied.</p>

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of years, but steel eventually suffers from corrosion and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
