<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Enola PA</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
