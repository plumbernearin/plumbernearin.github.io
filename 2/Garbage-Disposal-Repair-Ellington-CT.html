<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
