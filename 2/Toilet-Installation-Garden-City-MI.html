<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Garden City MI</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it too.</p>
