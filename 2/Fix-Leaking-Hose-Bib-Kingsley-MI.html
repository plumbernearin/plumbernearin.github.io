<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of small, maybe less vital things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
