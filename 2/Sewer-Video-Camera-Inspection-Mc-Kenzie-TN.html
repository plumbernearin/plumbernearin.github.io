This is due mostly to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening merely removes firmness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a problem and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not need. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the issue if this is the case.
