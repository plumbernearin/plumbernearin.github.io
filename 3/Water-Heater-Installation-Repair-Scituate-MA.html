<p>Burst Pipe Hydraulic Replacement - Like pipe relining, this also doesn't include digging and replacing. Rather, our service technicians utilize a rupturing tool that forces the existing pipeline to burst" and disintegrate. A new pipeline is immediately drawn in and fills in deep space created by the old, burst pipe in a commercial or residential sewer. This repair technique is typically used to replace the old pipe with a similar or bigger pipe.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
