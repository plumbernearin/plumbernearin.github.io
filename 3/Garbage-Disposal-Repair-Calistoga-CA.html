<p>Leak detection is a component of water preservation that relies on highly technical competence and specific equipment to identify the place of leaks throughout the city's water distribution system and identify the area of those leaks at which visible water may or may not have actually surfaced.

<h3>Backflow Prevention Device Testing & Repair in Calistoga California</h2>
<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
