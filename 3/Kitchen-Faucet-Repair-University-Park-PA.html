The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
