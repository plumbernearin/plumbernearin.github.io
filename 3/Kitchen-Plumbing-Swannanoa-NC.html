In some areas of Virginia, where the water is specifically difficult with high mineral material, you might need to flush the hot water heater more frequently.</p>

<p>Many property owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their clogged or unclean drain concerns.

This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always advised.</p>
