<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for residents. If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration instantly begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regrowth generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
