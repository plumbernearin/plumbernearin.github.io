<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and intricate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping.

High water pressure leads to leaks, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to take place without appropriate pressure reduction. You can likewise save on salt, water, and energy by using as much as 50% less cleaning agent for laundry and dishwashing, using up to 34% less salt and approximately 35% less water throughout regrowth.</p>
