Your kitchen may become clogged by food or grease, while in the bathroom it may be hair or pieces of soap that trigger the obstruction. Your toilet may end up being stopped due to excess paper being flushed, or you might have a house-wide backup brought on by sewage returning up through the pipes.</p>
<p>Each component of the assembly need to be evaluated to identify what is in need of repair. The field test might not always show you the severity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the fundamental rubber repair kit are required.
