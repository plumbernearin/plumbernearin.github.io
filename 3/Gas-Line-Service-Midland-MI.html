<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are significantly damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
