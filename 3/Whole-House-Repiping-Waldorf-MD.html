Inspecting the water meter is a fantastic next action in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and check.

<p>Bought middle ground stainless-steel blade design readily available at Lowes. Got a small local plumber who overcharged me, I think. $212 with tax for installation only, incl. new $25 strainer for the sink. Approximate. 1 hour work for two people.

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
