When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
