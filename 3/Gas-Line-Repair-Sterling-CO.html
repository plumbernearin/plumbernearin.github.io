<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Sterling CO</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>

If the drains clog periodically however you can generally flush them out, this might be a smaller clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom. Small obstructions can turn into huge ones relatively quickly.</p>
