<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers improves water's taste, but its high price tag makes it not practical as a household option. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothing, and, in many cases, consist of phosphates that damage the environment. A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning fraud.</p>

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
