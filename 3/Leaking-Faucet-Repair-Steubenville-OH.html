<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there should be no problem in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you need to probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
