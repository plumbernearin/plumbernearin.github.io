<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
