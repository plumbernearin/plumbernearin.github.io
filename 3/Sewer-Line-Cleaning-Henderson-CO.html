<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of preserving the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace hardness ions, likewise has a positive charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other. However, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange take place? There is another crucial aspect needed to make the procedure work: a resin bed including lots of small, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>Rusting and deterioration on the outside of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a potential problem with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can likewise mean the water heater is near the end of its life.
