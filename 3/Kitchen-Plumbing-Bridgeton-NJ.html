<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts.

Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
