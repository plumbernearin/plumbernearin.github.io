<p>These are fantastic water heaters and they are perfect for homes. Specifically for houses that have restricted area or utilize big quantities of hot water. Because they instantly heat water, there is no need to store already heated water and they use an endless quantity of warm water, which means you will never ever lack warm water.

Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned and sanitized during regeneration. Finally, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
