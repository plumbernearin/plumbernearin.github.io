<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
