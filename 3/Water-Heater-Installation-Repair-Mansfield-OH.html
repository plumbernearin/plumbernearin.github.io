<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the building; extra, more considerable costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for homeowners. If setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help identify.</p>
