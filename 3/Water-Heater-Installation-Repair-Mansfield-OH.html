<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.

If setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help identify.</p>
