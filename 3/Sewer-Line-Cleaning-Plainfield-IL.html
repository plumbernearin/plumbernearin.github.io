<p>Pipeline video inspection is a type of telepresence utilized to visually check the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A typical application is for a plumber to determine the condition of small diameter sewer lines and household connection drain pipes.

<p>Gas is tough to find, as it's a colorless, odor free substance. We use gas in our houses with gas ovens, heaters, and stoves. American houses access natural gas through miles and miles of underground pipelines. Having a gas leak from an outdoor pipeline and indoor home appliances can occur quickly and suddenly.

<p>House owners typically ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient. The answer depends on your home.

Electric varieties are also easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less most likely to lose heat.</p>
