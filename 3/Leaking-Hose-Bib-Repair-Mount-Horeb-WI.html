<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a viable service, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and family.</p>
