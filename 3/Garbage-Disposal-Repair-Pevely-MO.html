<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not uncommon, but if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a larger problem to examine. You may need to change toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is relatively new. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can look up your state's licensing details. Examine the list of state licensing firms to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise preserves a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features 2 fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
