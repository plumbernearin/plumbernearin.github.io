<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Calipatria CA</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning professionals are called into a residence is due to the fact that there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are pretty cheap and easy to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease strengthens it stays with the pipe and prevents water circulation, ultimately causing a backup. This included with other particles in your drain can trigger a significant backup.</p>
