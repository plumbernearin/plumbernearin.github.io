<h3>Icemaker box Repair in Everett Washington</h2>
<p>A guideline is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
