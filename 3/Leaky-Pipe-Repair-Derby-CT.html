<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
