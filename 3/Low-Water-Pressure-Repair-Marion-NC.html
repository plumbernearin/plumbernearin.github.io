<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less vital things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the perpetrator. However not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
