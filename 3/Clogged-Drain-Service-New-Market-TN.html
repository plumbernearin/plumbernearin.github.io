<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water system and private on-site supply of water and circulation systems by prohibiting cross-connections between drinkable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow methods offer an increased level of security for the general public water system system.</p>

<p>However, UPC model code needs stand-alone residential systems using non-potable piping materials to attain the same level of defense as a commercial system. When chemicals are included to a fire security system supplied by a drinkable water supply, increased defense is also required. If you have children, advise them to avoid hanging on any noticeable pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter. Holding on a pipeline may cause it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter need to be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>
