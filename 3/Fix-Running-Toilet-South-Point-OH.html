<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
