<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Birdsboro PA 19508?</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural items, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work much better than items including harsh chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical substance that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water rather than building up on surface areas. However, if they stay in one place for long, as they may in a water heater, the accumulation could still occur.</p>
