<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly.

A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
