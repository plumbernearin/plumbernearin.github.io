<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing property owners want to get their hands dirty with. It needs more than just effort to fix broken sewer systems, and the problem is often due to how problematic it is to evaluate the damage. This is much more problematic if the damage is permanent or needs more extensive repair, specifically in commercial settings.</p>
