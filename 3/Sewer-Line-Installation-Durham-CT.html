Easements (generally 10 feet large) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles however will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not.
