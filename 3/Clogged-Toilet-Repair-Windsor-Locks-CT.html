<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Most automobiles have a metal line that runs the length of the car with rubber fuel lines linking at either end, one at the fuel tank and the other to the engine.
