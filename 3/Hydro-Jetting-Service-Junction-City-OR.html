<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully listen and lift the rod. If the water shuts off, you might have the ability to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw.
