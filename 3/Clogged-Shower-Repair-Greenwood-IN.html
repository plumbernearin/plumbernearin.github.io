<p>The Delaware Division of Public Health Plumbing Authorization and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pushed forward into the property, allowing it to stream backwards into city water materials.</p>
<p>Backpressure happens when the pressure in a personal water supply exceeds the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can cause typical circulation to reverse. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a greater floor may trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains need to be carried out on all drains, including toilet, tub, sink and floor drains.</p>
