<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>

The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
