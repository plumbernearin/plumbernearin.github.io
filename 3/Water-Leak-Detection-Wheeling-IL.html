<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
