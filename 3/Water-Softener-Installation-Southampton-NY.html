<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
