Tank hot water heater are the most common, and are run with gas. Their style consists of an insulated tank where water is warmed and saved up until needed.

<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the brine tank in the kind of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
