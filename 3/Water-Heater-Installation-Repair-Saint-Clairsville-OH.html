<p>A rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the hot water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, UPC model code requires stand-alone residential systems utilizing non-potable piping materials to attain the exact same level of defense as a commercial system.
