<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove particles such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>

Residences built in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes.

For house, it is important for owners to alert the District if any changes are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial property, the District evaluates using each brand-new tenant. The correction should be made before water service is allowed if the present backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the home or the tenant owner.</p>
