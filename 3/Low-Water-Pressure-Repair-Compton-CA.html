It's so old that it is no longer able to push water through the toilet to completely clear the drain. This results in your toilet having a constant blocking issue.</p>
<p>If you have actually split or broken drains until a video inspection is performed, it's difficult to identify. Split or broken drains are typically preceded by recurring obstructions, consistent foul drain odors or the existence of sewer flies.

<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complex than changing with a different design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this might be something to think about. An entirely different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink connector needs to be puttied into location. A secure seal is a must. Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to connect wires accurately, and the base covered to secure the wiring from any water getting in.</p>

Both include a mechanical backflow preventer - basically, a physical barrier to the backflow. They were fantastic at repairing the clogged drain, but really very sloppy about fixing the chip in the sink and the use of puddy under the sink.</p>
