The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both places.

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
