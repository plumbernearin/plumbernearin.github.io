It's being shocked by a live wire while under a sink if there's anything even worse than being surprised by a live wire.</p>

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
