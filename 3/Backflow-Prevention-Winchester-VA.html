<p>Our team at All Stage Plumbing also utilizes drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a kind of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also referred to as trenchless pipe lining is a long lasting and exceptional option for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining procedure includes our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. When the felt liner is completely filled, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all fractures and flaws. If heat is used, the liner is left to solidify in location for a number of hours or 60 minutes. Once the procedure is total, the liner will be gotten rid of and your pipe will be inspected one more time to make certain your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
