Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
