Before installing, your professional will turn off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is connected to its install. In this approach, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there should be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you should most likely not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
