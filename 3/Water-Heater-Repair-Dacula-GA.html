<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
