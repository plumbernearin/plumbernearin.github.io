Examining the water meter is a terrific next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and inspect if the water meter is turning. There is a leak somewhere and this could be major problem if it is. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in your house should have water. This goes for every other shut off valve and their matching faucets. You are off to a good start if everything is working properly.</p>
<p>Drain cleanouts provide an entry point into your house's drainage system so blockages can be gotten rid of. They are generally white pipes located outside your home but can be other colors.
