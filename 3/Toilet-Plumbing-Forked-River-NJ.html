<p>It is approximated that the typical person spends over 3 years of their life sitting on the toilet, and numerous bathroom readers are at danger of becoming permanently attached to the fixture. Which is why picking a comfortable, well-made toilet seat is very important. Nevertheless, you need to make sure your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. Most of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and comfort. Some toilets, however, have distinctively shaped bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It really isn't a good concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have been specifically developed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or won't distribute your weight uniformly and could ultimately trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the concern.
