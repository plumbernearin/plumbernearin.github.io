I picked this company since they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it too.</p>
