<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to ensure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
