<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Poughkeepsie NY</h3>

Some house owners will attempt to remove the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These solutions do work, particularly if you are dealing with a small drain clog. Nevertheless, they are typically temporary repairs that do not offer permanent resolutions.</p>

<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
