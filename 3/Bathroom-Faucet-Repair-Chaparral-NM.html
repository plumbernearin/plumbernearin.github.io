<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Chaparral NM 88081</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
