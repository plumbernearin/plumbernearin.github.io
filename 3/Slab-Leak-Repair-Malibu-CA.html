<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to guarantee that all plumbing set up throughout building of a new or remodelled structure is installed by well-informed craftsmen in accordance with applicable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you typically know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is most likely in the draining fixture itself. Clogs in a component can trigger damaging damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
