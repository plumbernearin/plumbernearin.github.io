When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you typically know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is most likely in the draining fixture itself. Clogs in a component can trigger damaging damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
