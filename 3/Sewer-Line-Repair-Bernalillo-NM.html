<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a practical service, especially when basic plunging does not appear to work.

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
