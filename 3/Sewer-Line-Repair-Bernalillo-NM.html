<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a practical service, especially when basic plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and household.</p>
