<p>Carefully listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm.

<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a viable option, particularly when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>
