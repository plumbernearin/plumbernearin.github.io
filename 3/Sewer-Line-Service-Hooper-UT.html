Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
