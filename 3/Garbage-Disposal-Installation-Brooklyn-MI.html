<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Brooklyn MI 49230</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains.

If you reside in an earthquake-prone area, strap the water heater to the wall with unique straps (Fig. A; available at plumbing stores and home centers). Your plumbing inspector will tell you if they're needed.</p>

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can end up being a health risk in your water.</p>
