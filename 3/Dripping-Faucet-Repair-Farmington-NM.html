<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains.

The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
