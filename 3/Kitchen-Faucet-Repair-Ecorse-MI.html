<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for carrying out annual forward circulation tests are sometimes viewed as a mandate to have them. But the intent of the code is to only attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers are present.</p>
