<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Our group at All Phase Plumbing likewise utilizes drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a form of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also referred to as trenchless pipe lining is a exceptional and long lasting  alternative for your broken pipes. The pipe lining process involves our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. When the felt liner is entirely filled, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and cracks. The liner is left to harden in place for numerous hours or 60 minutes if heat is used. When the procedure is complete, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be inspected one more time to make sure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
