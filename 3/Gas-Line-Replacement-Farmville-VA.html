<p>If your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing a stoppage, with PVC you have a couple of options. The other is to go on and replace the whole line. If the line is about 40 years old and is showing signs of age throughout, definitely replace. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it may be an appropriate option to do just that. However, if the balanced out worsens trenchless may no longer be a choice.</p>
