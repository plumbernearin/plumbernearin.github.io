<p>Gas lines are crucial for homes: they power stoves, hot water heater, and other devices to keep you dry, warm, and comfy all year long.

<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not uncommon, however if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to examine. If your toilet is relatively new, you may need to switch toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain.
