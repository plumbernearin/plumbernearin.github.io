If your house was developed before the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you work with a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. Chances are that your house may need substantial repiping so that your house's plumbing can function at optimum rates if your home was developed years before that.</p>
