<p>When the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
