<p>A common whole-house repipe can take anywhere from three to five days, depending upon the size of the house, the number of levels it has and the chosen pipe material. Throughout a repipe, plumbers will make tactical cuts in the drywall, completely replace the pipes, reinstall the removed drywall and spot it to erase any signs of damage or modification to your house.</p>
<p>The typical plumber's per hour wage is $68-$ 138. Lot of times easy repairs, such as unclogging a toilet or a drain, will have a repaired price of about $220 unless there are extenuating circumstances. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a cost to look at your circumstance and tell you what needs to be done, but if you hire them, that charge will be subtracted from the costs. A plumber may charge $50-$ 100 to diagnose the issue and come. 2 Needing to call a plumber after hours, on the weekend, or on a vacation will cost more.</p>
<p>As the hardness in the water increases, so does the annual cost savings. In a 40-gpg hard water market, salt cost savings alone can reach $1,144 annually.
