<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Bardstown KY 40004</h3>
<p>Water heater diagnostics: We determine what is incorrect with your water heater, in addition to what maintenance work requires to be performed moving forward. Water softeners generally utilize sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are supplied from liquified sodium chloride salt, also called salt water. In the ion exchange process, salt ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that resemble damp sand.</p>
<p>Finding the area or source of a problem is done through visual inspection of sewer pipes, color testing, and closed circuit video of the sewer main. By checking the inside of drains, crews can identify the source of the problem, nature of the blockage, and condition of the pipe If you live in Ames, IA, plumbing installation from Principle Plumbing, Heating & Cooling can take care of a complete repiping quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, but if your toilet is clogging more than three times a month, there's a bigger issue to examine.
