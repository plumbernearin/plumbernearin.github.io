<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
