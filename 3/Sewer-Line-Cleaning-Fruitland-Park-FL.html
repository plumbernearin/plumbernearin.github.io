<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leaks under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making a good seal. Eliminate the drain stopper, and allow the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leaks and tighten up as required. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cables as preferred.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
