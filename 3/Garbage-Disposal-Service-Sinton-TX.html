<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short.

<p>Gas leaks are commonly found at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that enables connections and disconnections of gas appliances.

You likely have a gas leak and should instantly call a gas plumber to carry out an emergency gas line repair if it bubbles.</p>

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey rate entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
