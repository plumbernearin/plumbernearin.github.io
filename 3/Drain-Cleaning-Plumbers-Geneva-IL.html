<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each component. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities.

In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
