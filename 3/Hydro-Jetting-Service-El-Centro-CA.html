<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
