When a brand-new house is constructed, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, faucets and sinks need to be set up correctly and to local, state, and federal code. While your go-to plumber might be a great candidate for unclogging your toilet, a more specific plumber should be used for home remodeling work.</p>
<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible solution, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they generally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>
