When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains.

<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Nebo NC</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it too.</p>
