<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complex than replacing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this may be something to think about. An entirely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink port has to be puttied into location. A secure seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to connect wires properly, and the base covered to safeguard the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions other than straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance.

All gas piping installations require a permit and inspection.</p>
