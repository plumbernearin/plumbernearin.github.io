<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific person. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as assured.

<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working effectively since hard water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use more and more detergent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Lastly, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
