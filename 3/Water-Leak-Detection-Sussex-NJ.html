<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids.
