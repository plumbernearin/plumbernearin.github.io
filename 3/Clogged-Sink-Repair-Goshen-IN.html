All replacements must be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the appropriate type of assembly based on the conditions on your home (see section listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly should satisfy the lead complimentary requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 1 month, all water services will be terminated up until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
