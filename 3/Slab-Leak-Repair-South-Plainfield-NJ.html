<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required.

<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber South Plainfield NJ</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
