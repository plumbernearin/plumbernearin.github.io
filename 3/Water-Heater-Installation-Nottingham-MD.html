Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the unit in a safe and steady  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. You must wait until after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth.
