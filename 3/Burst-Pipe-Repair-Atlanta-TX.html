<p>You probably know something about your drains: they take water from your bathtubs, showers, and sinks to a local water treatment center. When drains are working effectively that's really all you need to know about them, however when something goes wrong, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what sort of problems can take place in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber can be found in-- they have the knowledge to detect a problem and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool producer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done independently. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as two hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
