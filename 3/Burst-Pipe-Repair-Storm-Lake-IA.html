<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
