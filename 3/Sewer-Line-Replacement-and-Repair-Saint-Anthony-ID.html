<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation. I've consulted a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to corrode and burst when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, waste disposal unit do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
