<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.
