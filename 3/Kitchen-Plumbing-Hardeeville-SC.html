<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent person. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you may be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted appropriately (Picture 8). You don't need to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Drawbacks to be familiar with is that hybrid hot water heater need to be installed in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
