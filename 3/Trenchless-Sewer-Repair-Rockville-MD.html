<p>Recommendations: A skilled plumbing company need to be able to give you the names of recent customers in your part of town. It can take a DIYer a great deal of time to locate and total simple repairs, so think about that with the cost when trying to deal with the problem on your own. The reason a toilet will not flush might be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain below the toilet can likewise be the cause. Employing a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your first step; a plumber can diagnose the issue and repair it.</p>
