<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines.

<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair specialist knows the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

<p>In water circulation systems, water is typically maintained at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may stop working or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
