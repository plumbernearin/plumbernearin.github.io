This is due largely to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening just gets rid of hardness minerals and removes problems that are a nuisance and not a hazard to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
<p>If you have your water tested, the report will utilize one or both of these systems to tell you how tough your water is.

Double Check Valve assemblies are the most common type utilized on irrigation systems in Horseshoe Bay.</p>
