<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Durango CO</h3>
<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply gets rid of hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a nuisance and not a hazard to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not necessity. However, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>If the sound of your toilet continuously running is regular to you, then you've got an issue with over-running or leaking. This water is being disposed down the overflow tube losing up to 200 gallons of water per day. That takes a toll on your water costs, not to discuss the danger of a more severe leak that might ruin your house with flooding.</p>
