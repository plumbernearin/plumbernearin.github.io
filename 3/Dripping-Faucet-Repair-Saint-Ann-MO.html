The new pipe, made from a state-of-the-art, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall product are removed to attach the pipes to the water fixtures, Wood says.

Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted properly (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
