<p>In water circulation systems, water is typically kept at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may stop working or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
