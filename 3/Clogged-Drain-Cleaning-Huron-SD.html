<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
