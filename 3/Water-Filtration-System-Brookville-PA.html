<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the best length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation.

To avoid this, make certain the brand-new waste disposal unit installation kit includes a tube, or buy one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>
