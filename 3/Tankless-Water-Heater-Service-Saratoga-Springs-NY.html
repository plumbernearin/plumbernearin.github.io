<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Saratoga Springs NY</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had excellent evaluations and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it also.</p>

Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.
