<p>E.R. Services comprehends the value of maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace hardness ions, also has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other. However, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange occur? There is one other essential element required to make the process work: a resin bed including lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complicated clinical procedure, however easy to fix. It utilizes salt to get rid of smells and minerals discovered in hard water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that connect and draw in salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
