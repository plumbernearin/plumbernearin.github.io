The research study included tests that removed challenging soils, in addition to evaluating spotting and shooting. Scientists found that softened water utilizes practically 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans along with water at 10 gpg solidity level. That cleaning agent cost savings rises to almost 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>
