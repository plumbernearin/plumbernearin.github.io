<p>Surface Accelerated Formation is a development that mimics biomineralization, the system frequently recognized for structured development in the environment, consisting of seashells. Water softening is attained with SACr by utilizing exclusive polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads speed up the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely get rid of momentary hardness in water.</p>
<p>In reality, that's how tough water" got its name, from the hardened mineral deposits this sort of water leaves behind. With time these deposits can accumulate, clog, or perhaps wear away pipes and trigger significant plumbing problems.

<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work.
