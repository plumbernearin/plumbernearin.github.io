Throughout regrowth, salted water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>While city water does get treated, it is done for purposes of getting rid of bacterial problems and making the water drinkable. These are certainly top priorities for a town and its residents but tough water can negatively affect faucets and devices in a home. With the high calcium material of local water, it can trigger a dishwasher or water heater to breakdown.</p>

When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
