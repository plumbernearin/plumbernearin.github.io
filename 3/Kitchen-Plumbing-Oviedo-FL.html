<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with recognized backflow gadgets on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs. Rotate the disposal unit to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it. Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
