<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
