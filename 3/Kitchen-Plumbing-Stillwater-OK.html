<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is without firmness ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>Plumbing is an essential part of your home or organisation, and its capability to function is vital. If you experience regular problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this could be a sign of a bigger problem, like a tree root invasion or a big clog.
