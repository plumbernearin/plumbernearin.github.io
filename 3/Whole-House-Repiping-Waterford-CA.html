<p>Check the house's warm water heater You will be aiming to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a household of four should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be heated up and readily available for use. Likewise, rust of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a short life. If the hot water heater is old or you see apparent indications of deterioration, demand that a new one be set up.</p>
