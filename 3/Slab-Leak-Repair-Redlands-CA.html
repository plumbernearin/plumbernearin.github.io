<p>You probably know something about your drains: they take water from your bathtubs, showers, and sinks to a local water treatment center. When drains are working properly that's truly all you need to learn about them, however when something goes wrong, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what sort of problems can take place in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage.

Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
