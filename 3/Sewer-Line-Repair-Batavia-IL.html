<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding.

The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
