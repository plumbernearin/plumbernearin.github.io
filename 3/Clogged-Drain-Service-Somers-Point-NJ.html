Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
