<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey rate entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>If you've ever been frustrated by cloudy white areas on your dishes that won't go away, white t-shirts that turn gray and dull after a few washes, or a stubborn layer of soap residue in your shower, you'll enjoy to understand that water softening can remove these problems and more. Hard water triggers these issues due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash. With softened water, you will not need to fret about any problems with mineral deposits remaining. This makes tasks easier and less irritating for everybody involved.</p>
