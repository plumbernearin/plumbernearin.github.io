<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to conserve money. While this might work in the short-term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the same material as other pipes in your home, suggesting that difficulty could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you assurance and prevent larger leakages down the roadway.</p>
