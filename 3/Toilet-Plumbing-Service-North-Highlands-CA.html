<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
