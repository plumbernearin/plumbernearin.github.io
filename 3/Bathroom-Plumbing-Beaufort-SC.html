<h3>Most Typical Plumbing Services Beaufort SC</h3>
<p>To figure out if your home is a poly home," start with the outside. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it gets in the house near the water heater. Your main turned off is connected to the end of the water pipe. Ensure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under your house is merely the cost to install a brand-new plumbing system which can vary from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per direct foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under homes, sometimes in concrete. It is rather typical to leave the old pipes in place after detaching them. The new pipe is just set up in the course of least resistance. Depending on the design of your home, the pipe can be installed in the attic or under a crawl area.</p>
