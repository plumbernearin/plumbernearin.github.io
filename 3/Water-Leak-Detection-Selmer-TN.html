<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
