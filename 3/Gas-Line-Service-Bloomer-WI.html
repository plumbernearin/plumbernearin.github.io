Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly stream toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The demand upstream might cause a reversal in circulation.</p>
