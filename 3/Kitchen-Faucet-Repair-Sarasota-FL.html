<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Sarasota FL</h3>
<p>To determine if your house is a poly house," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can likewise be black or gray). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it goes into the home near the water heater. Your main shut off is attached to the end of the water pipe. Ensure you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Water softeners normally have a lifespan of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are appropriately maintained. Ensuring the brine tank never lacks salt will extend the unit's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also protect the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners improve the regeneration cycle and help relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
