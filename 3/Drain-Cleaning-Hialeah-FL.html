<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Step, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it may need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
