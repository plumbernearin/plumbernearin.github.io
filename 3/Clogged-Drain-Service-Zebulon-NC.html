Rotate the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that link it. Relying on the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or irreversible connection in between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's potable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>

Another risk in sewer repair tasks is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig website. Your safety and health are too essential to risk in a DIY sewer project! Prevent these security hazards by employing a professional plumber.</p>
