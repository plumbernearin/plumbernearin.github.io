<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the best length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may need to make a time-wasting journey to the store. To avoid this, ensure the brand-new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one individually at the same time for about $3.</p>
