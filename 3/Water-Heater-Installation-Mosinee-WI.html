The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs record moisture so that it does not go into the control system. Although little pieces of sediment might make it through a drip leg.</p>

Make sure it's adjusted properly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
