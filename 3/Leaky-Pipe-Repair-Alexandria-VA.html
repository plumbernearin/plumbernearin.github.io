<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Alexandria VA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
