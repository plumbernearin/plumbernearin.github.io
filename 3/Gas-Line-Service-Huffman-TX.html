<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and costly plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a hard job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
<p>Installing a salt-based softener or water softener alternative provides much better, much safer drinking water.
