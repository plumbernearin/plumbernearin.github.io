<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
