Leakages can also take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a stable and safe location.

You should wait until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You ought to also inspect to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
