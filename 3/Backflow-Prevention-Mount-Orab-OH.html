<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Mount Orab OH</h3>
<p>It's at the end of its natural life and you're much better off getting a brand-new one if your hot water tank is over 15 years old.
