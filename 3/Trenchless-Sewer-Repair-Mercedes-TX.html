<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. It was a tough job because of the age of the house and area of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working prior to they left. I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public water system and private on-site water system and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections in between safe and clean (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of secondary and main backflow prevention approaches.

<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your backyard. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
