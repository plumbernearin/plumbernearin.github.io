<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Daily usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can likewise occur if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the system in a stable and safe location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you should wait up until after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings. You must also check to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
