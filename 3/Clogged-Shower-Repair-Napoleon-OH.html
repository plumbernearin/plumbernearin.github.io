Due to the large number of toilets, we have repaired many toilets in houses throughout the Tampa area so we are very familiar with the products used and how they are set up here locally. We likewise have done many toilet replacements as well; this is usually called for when either a resident chooses to replace their toilet with maybe a more efficient one or when a toilet is simply beyond repair.</p>
<p>Toilets are challenging things to know. They've been built basically the same way for centuries, so you can't really tell how old they are. It might not work very well all the time, but you can't tell if that's regular or not.
