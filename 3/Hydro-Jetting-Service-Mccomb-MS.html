<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective operating a necessity more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system.

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both.
