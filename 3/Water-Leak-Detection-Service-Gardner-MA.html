<p>Setting up a new gas line in the kitchen will usually vary from $300 to $800 depending on the length of the pipe needed. If you're converting your home to natural gas, or if the present line is at capacity, expect to invest $2,000 or more. New gas line expenses consist of device connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
