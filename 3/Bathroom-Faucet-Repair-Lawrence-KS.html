<p>When utilized in fighting a fire, fire department connections can be a problem. Firemen by and large are not worried about backflow prevention issues. They are concerning with protecting people's lives and to a lesser extent their home. Getting the required volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will utilize water from any source offered to achieve that objective.

<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a viable service, specifically when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your home and household.</p>
