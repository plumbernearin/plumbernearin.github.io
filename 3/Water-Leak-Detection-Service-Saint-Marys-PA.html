<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding.

When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
