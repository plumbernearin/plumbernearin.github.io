<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a service of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than items consisting of severe chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>I can't state enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had an extremely brief amount of time due to closing on a home sale. Every individual I came across from Marquita doing logistics for my job to every member of the work team. Friendly, communicated well, completely responsive and really cared to help me through this extremely demanding task. All of the people I experienced were good example for what a well run service business should be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're excellent.</p>
<p>Some house owners might think about water softeners as a high-end item, something that's nice to have" but not entirely essential. However, difficult water can cause everything from small annoyances, like areas on meals or soap residue, to significant problems like a shorter life expectancy for your hot water heater, dishwasher, and other important home appliances. For these factors and others, a water softener can be a helpful financial investment for your house.</p>
