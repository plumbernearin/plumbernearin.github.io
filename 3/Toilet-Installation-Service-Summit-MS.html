Sediment Accumulation: If you see strange popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating element. Running out of warm water quickly is another sign of sediment build-up, because the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
