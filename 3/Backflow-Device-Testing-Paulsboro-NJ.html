Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
