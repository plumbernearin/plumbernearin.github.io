As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there ought to be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you must most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils.
