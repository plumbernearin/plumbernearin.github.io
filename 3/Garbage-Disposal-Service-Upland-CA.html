<p>Changing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complicated than changing with a different model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this might be something to think about. A completely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink adapter has to be puttied into location. A safe seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to connect wires precisely, and the base covered to safeguard the circuitry from any water getting in.</p>
