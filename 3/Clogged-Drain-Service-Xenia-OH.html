Sanford & Boy plumbing provides sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. During regeneration, salty water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>

Trenchless pipe repair is a form of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also called trenchless pipe lining is a long lasting and exceptional option for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining process includes our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. When the felt liner is completely saturated, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and cracks. If heat is used, the liner is left to harden in place for several hours or 60 minutes. When the process is total, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be inspected one more time to make sure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
