As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the best length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation.
