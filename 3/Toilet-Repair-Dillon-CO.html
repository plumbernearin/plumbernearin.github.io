<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a practical service, specifically when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are lots of downsides to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
