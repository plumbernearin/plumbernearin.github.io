The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
