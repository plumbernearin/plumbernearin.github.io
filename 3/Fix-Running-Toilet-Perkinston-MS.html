<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leaks under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making a good seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and allow the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Look for leaks and tighten up as necessary. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cables as desired.</p>
<p>Drains clog for a reason, but it's not always apparent. It is highly recommended that a professional plumber carry out a camera inspection on a main sewer line after it has actually clogged. This is twice as essential if you're acquiring a house. Imagine in the above situation knowing the condition of the line prior to the purchase of a home. You can't always be particular whether the house has actually had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous house owner knew the reason for the clog A basic camera inspection might make you aware of a concealed and really pricey  issue prior to the purchase.</p>
