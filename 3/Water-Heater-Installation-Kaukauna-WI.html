<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
