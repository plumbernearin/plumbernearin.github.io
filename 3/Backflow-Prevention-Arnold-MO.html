<p>Examples of backflow conditions consist of backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can conserve your plumbing system from unneeded blockages further down the water lines. In some instances, resins can not be washed of impurities and will need to be replaced. (This need to not be the case if the resin is regularly regrowed and kept.) Consult your water softener dealer for info on resin replacement.</p>
<p>These concerns can be taken care of except for cracks in the body or interior lining of the disposal. You will need to install a new garbage disposal if this is your problem.
