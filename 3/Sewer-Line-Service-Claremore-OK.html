<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. If it has, you most likely have a leak.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully lift the rod and listen. If the water turns off, you may have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no change screw, bend the float arm.
