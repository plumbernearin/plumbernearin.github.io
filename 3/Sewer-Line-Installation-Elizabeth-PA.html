<p>Aside from these 2 crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less crucial things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
