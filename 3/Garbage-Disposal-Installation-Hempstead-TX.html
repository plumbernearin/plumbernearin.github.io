<p>Carbon monoxide is released when gas burns incompletely. The signs are the same as direct exposure to gas leak. The exposure to carbon monoxide is so fatal that anybody who inhales it requires immediate medical attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that 5149 people died from carbon monoxide poisoning in between 1999 and 2010. To prevent this disaster, make sure to use your gas ranges exactly as instructed and never ever to utilize them to warm your home. The exact same opts for portable gas ranges, which are to be utilized outdoors only and not inside. When running the space-heaters, ensure somebody is awake to monitor them.
