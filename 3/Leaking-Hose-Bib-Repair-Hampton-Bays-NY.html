For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
