<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Daily use need to not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also take place if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a safe and stable  area.
