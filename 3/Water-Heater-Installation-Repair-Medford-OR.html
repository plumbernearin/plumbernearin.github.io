<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Medford OR 97504</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
