<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your security, benefit, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system.

A backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve arrangement created to prevent the reversal of the flow of water once it has travelled through the valve.

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
