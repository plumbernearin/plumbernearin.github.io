<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
