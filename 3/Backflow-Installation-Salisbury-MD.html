<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Salisbury MD</h3>
<p>Split sewer pipes can be more than just a costly repair-- they can lead to comprehensive and pricey home damage and result in serious health risks. Sewer line repair is the very first line of defense when a sewer line stops working. Sewer line replacement is the only other option if the sewer line can't be fixed. Thankfully, Mr. Rooter Â® Plumbing is your local source for quality sewer repair and replacement at any time.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as difficult water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
