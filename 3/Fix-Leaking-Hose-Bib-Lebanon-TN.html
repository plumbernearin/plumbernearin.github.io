<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally preserved at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or stop working decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened).

<p>Plumbing is an essential part of your house or organisation, and its ability to function is essential. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains clogging, this might be a sign of a bigger problem, like a tree root invasion or a large clog.

Small clogs can become big ones fairly quickly.</p>
