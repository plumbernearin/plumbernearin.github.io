<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to clogs that originate inside the home. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also referred to as tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently set up, such as cast iron, copper, clay or plastic, will determine the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation in a potable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just stream in one direction.

If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The need upstream might cause a reversal in circulation.</p>
