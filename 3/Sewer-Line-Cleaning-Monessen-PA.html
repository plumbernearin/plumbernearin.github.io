This 3-stage water treatment system with a stainless-steel filter media tank will filter and soften your water for many years to come.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt since they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, normally regenerate after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
