<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Duluth GA</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
