<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<h3>When To Call A Plumber Asheboro NC</h3>
<p>In addition to providing prompt, effective hot water heater repair services, our knowledgeable plumbing specialists at Big Blue Plumbing in Alameda, CA, provide full hot water heater installation. Often a repair simply won't take care of the issue you're experiencing, while other times the expense of the repair isn't worth spending on an old hot water heater. Whatever the reason, there are times when purchasing a new water heater ends up being the necessary option.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the property (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire security systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or debris in the water line avoids them from closing entirely, backflow can take place.</p>
