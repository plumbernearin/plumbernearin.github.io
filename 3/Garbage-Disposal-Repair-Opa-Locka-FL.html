<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed due to the fact that of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.
