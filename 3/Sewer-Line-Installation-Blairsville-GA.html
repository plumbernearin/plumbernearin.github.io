<p>Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of circulation in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to assist fight a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The demand upstream might trigger a turnaround in flow.</p>

A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a greater floor might cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains ought to be carried out on all drains, consisting of toilet, sink, floor and tub drains.</p>
