<p>A site strategy (to scale or with dimensions) of the facility containing a basic area map, name and address of facility, residential or commercial property lines, structures, the size and area of public water pipe( s) and all fire and domestic water services, meter pits, yard piping and hydrants, pumper connection( s), interconnections, and the place of the proposed backflow preventer( s).</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
