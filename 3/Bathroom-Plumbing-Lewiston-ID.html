<p>House owners typically ask if a gas water heater or an electric system is more cost-effective. The response depends upon your home.

Electric ranges are also easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>

If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
