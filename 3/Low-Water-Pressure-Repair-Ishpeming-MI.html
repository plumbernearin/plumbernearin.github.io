<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (normally 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Some softeners deal with electricity, but some more recent water softeners use waterpower. Expenses of a water softener greatly rely on the type of water softener and the kind of energy that is utilized, but also upon the hardness of the water that requires softening and the water use. When the water is extremely hard and it is used heavily, the costs of softening will rise.</p>
