<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
