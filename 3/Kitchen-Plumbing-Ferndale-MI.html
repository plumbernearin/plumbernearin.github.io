<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Day to day usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can likewise occur if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the system in a stable and safe area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing. You must wait till after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regeneration. You should also check to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
