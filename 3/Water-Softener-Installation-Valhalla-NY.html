<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In Valhalla NY</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it also.</p>
