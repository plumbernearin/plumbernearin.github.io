<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>

<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This rust can result in a buildup of lead, which can have many unfavorable results on your health. Rusty pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool manufacturer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done individually.
