<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
