These materials gather in the drain and eventually harden against the pipe walls, making them tough to remove. Your hot water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leakages are one of the most typical indications that your unit is at the end of its life-span, especially if they are triggering major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
