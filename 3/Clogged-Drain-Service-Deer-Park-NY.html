<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The service technician shut off the supply of water and loosened the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor.

<h3>Hydro Scrub Jetting in Deer Park New York</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
