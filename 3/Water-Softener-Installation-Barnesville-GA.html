<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are significantly damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
