<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>

<p>The most reliable method to resolve tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
