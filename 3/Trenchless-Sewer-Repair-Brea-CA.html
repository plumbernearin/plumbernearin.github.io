<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing installed during building and construction of a brand-new or refurbished structure is set up by knowledgeable artisans in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains.

A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning fraud.</p>
