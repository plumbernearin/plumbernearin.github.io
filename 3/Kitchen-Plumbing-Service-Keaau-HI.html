<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and complex plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can cause rust that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
