<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the unit in a safe and stable  location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing. You need to wait until after the cycle is finished and then examined the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth. You need to also inspect to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
