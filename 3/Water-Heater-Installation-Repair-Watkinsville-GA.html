<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less important things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>

If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your water heater really rapidly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
