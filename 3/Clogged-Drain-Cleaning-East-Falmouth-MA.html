<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service East Falmouth MA</h3>
<p>To figure out if your house is a poly house," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it gets in the house near the water heater. Your main shut off is attached to the end of the water main. Make certain you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe gets in the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>For reliable and safe clog elimination, it's best to go with professional drain cleaning. This service is completely safe for your pipes and is understood to enhance the total health and longevity of your plumbing system. Once or twice per year to make sure everything's running smoothly, we suggest investing in professional cleanings at least.</p>

<p>Frequently brought on by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then examine and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is typically the fix. Additionally, sometimes a faulty fill valve may activate periodically, too. Water won't drain or is draining slowly through the disposal.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to blockages with food and grease being the significant offenders. If fats are poured down the sink, they cake to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls also. Even tree roots can develop serious drain clogs by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to find and repair the problem for regular house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned before it leads to further damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is happening to your house.</p>
