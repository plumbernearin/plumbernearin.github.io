<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of preserving the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace solidity ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other.

There is another important aspect required to make the process work: a resin bed consisting of lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there must be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through.

Another idea to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
