<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the major culprits. If fats are poured down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls also. Even tree roots can create severe drain clogs by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to repair the concern and find for regular house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned before it leads to more damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is taking place to your house.</p>
