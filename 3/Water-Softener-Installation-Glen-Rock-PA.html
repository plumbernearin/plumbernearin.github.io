<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: On average, replacing a gas or electrical water tank with a comparable model takes two to three hours. It takes between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, detach and eliminate your old hot water heater. Positioning the brand-new system takes roughly thirty minutes, and it takes another 45 to 60 minutes to protect the new connection points and confirm that all functions are up to code.</p>
