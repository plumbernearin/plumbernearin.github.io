Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and takes away from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
