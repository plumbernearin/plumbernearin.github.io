<p>Galvanized metal, is just an easier way of saying zinc covered" and what triggers galvanized pipes to corrode is the direct exposure to excessive water and minerals. You may be thinking that it does not make sense to utilize a pipe that reacts with water as your home's main source of water transportation, and you would be appropriate. However, when most of these pipes were being set up, nobody understood this was going to be the result. Fortunately, there are a great deal of other piping choices nowadays including copper.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in a solution and is utilized to express the intensity of the acidity of a solution. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up deterioration Carbon dioxide will potentially contribute to the development of carbonic acid, therefore making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of co2 tends to associate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
