<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
