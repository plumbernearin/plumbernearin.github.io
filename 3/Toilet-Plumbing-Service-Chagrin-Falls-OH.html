<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the very first most obvious signs of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple problem such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your home. Even if the issue stems with the municipal system, it's still wise to generate the professionals to limit the damage to your home.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
