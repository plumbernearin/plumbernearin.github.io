<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it may require extra adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
