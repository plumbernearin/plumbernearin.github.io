<p>Having a plumbing company on hand that you can call is crucial since you have to move quickly in the face of a gas leak. Gene Johnson Plumbing & Heating has actually technicians extensively trained to discover the location of the leak, and either repair or replace the pipe, depending on the intensity of the leak.
