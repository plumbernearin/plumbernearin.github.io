<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there should be no issue in getting most of the waste through.

Another pointer to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
