The research study included tests that eliminated challenging soils, in addition to assessing filming and spotting. Researchers found that softened water uses nearly 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans along with water at 10 gpg solidity level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent cost savings increases to nearly 70%.</p>
