It includes blades, a mix of electric work, and plumbing which then implies a mix of electrical energy and water. Mishaps involving garbage disposals are too common to put yourself at risk. Considering the life span of a disposal, it would also be unnecessarily costly to purchase all the products and tools required for the task.

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high risk security assembly.</p>
