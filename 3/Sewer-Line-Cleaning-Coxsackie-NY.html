<p>Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the hardness ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 need to be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down. When it concerns pipe repair, the most costly elements aren't the machinery or products used, but the uprooting, lawn and landscaping damage that ensues.</p>
