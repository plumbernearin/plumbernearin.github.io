Another idea to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils.

The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
