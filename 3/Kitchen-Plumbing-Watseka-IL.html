<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Watseka IL 60970</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of circulation in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The need upstream could trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>
