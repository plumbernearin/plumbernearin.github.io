<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will develop.

Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
