<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to conduct site inspections to identify if a backflow prevention device is needed as an outcome of a actual or prospective  cross-connection danger on a client's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections located on Vashon Island are only performed on Wednesdays. Area Repairs: Using one or a mix of the above services, we will fix the problems we find with the camera inspection directly without uprooting anymore than we need to.</p>

<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets must absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet should be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
