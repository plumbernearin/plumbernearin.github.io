<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and expensive plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a challenging task because of the age of the house and area of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
