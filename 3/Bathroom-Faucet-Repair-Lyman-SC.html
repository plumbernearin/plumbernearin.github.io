<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply.

Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
