He noted that there are particular pollutants that citizens are handling and an RO can help reduce those problems. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils and that too can be fixed with the ideal RO system.</p>
