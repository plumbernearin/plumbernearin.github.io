<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating San Luis Obispo CA</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had great reviews and a reasonable cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it too.</p>
