<p>As a locally-owned organisation, stability and responsibility are incredibly essential to building a reputation for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable water system within a building these devices are known as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no chance to provide one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
