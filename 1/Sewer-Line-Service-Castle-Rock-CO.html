It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a correctly working RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water.

Appropriate drainage must also be offered.</p>
