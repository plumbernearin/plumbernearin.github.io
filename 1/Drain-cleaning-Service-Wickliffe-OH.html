<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great guy. He informed me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as promised. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Toilet flush handles are another part of a toilet that can trigger toilets to keep running. Typically manages are toilet parts that get corroded or loose and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down correctly. It's a simple repair, however there's a technique to getting the flush deal with out. The maintaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen up (Picture 1). Then eliminate the old manage and lever, slide the brand-new handle into place, and thread on the retaining nut. Tighten up by relying on the right (Picture 2).</p>
