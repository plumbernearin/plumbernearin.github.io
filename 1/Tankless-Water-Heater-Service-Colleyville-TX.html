<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might need additional adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
