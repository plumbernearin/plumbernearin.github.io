<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Rusting and corrosion on the outside of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a potential concern with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also indicate the water heater is near the end of its life.
