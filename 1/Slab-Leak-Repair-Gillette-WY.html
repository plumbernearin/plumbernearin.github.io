<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a fantastic guy. He informed me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as assured. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Your expenses also will include your plumber's charge for eliminating your old disposal and linking the brand-new one. A lot of plumbers charge by the hour, so any problems that emerge will increase the cost. Any damage to you old disposal or connection site might impact the time it takes.
