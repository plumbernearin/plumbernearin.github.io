<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Keeping your trash dispoal clean isn't really tough or time consuming. Fill the sink at least half loaded with soapy water.
