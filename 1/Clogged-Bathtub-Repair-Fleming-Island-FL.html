<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
