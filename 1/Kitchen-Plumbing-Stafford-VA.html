<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
