<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Verona NJ</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
