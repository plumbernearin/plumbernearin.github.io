<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Owens Cross Roads AL 35763</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic products, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than products including extreme chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or components.</p>

<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>While pipe lining is a great option for many people, there are some scenarios where repiping is the only alternative. Repiping is the procedure of replacing old corroded pipes with durable and lasting brand-new pipes. Since of their resilience and other aspects, the new pipes that are used are typically made of copper. Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and constructed of galvanized metals.</p>
