Local plumber priced quote price of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ happy I checked around. Under the sink, position a bucket or pan underneath the waste pipe, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
