<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your hot water heater installation consultation. Installing natural gas lines can bring a new level of service. As hard water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause difficult water adhere to the beads, and the cured water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
