<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
