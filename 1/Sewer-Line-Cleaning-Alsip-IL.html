The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers personal choice not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>

Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
