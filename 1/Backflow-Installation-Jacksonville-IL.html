There are many reasons that a homeowner would choose to purchase a brand-new gas line installation. Here are some of the most considerable factors.

<p>Once the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
