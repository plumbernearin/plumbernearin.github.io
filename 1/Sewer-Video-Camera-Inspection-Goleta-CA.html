<p>Split sewer pipes can be more than just a costly repair-- they can lead to extensive and pricey home damage and lead to serious health dangers.

Fortunately, Mr. Rooter ® Plumbing is your local source for quality sewer repair and replacement at any time.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as tough water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
