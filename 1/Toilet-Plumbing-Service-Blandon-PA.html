<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Blandon PA</h3>
<p>To figure out if your house is a poly house," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it gets in the home near the water heater. Your main shut off is connected to the end of the water main. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe gets in the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain won't fix the concern. You might have to check out utilizing a high pressure water system to remove the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the intensity of the clog. There are two standard piping materials used by plumbing experts. PEX and copper both provide many benefits and advantages such as getting rid of the metal taste from your water.</p>
