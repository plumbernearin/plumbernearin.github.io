<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical compound that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than developing on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the accumulation could still occur.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically starts. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>

Installation strategies include fast fitting connections, similar to those used for laundry devices. It is essential for homeowners to make certain that gas lines are replaced the correct way. Gas lines that are set up improperly can bring in additional cost to repair them.</p>
