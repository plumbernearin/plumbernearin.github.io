<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically starts. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
