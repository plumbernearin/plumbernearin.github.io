<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; extra, more substantial expenses can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for locals. A PE or RA can help identify if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>
