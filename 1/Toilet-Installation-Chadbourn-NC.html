<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it might require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
