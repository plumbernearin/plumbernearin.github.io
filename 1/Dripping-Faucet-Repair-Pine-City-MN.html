<p>As a locally-owned service, stability and responsibility are incredibly crucial to building a track record for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the safe and clean water supply within a building these gadgets are called seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no other way to offer one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
