<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing set up throughout building of a brand-new or renovated building is set up by knowledgeable artisans in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. However, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining fixture itself. Blockages in a fixture can cause detrimental damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
<p>We use both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping procedure. Since it is long enduring and durable, copper is the industry standard.
