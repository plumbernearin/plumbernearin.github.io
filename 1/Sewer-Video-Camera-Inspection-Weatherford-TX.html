The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>

This remains in addition to any interior gas lines or extensions that need to be set up. You'll have the disposer system, the sink-mounting assembly, an L-shaped tailpipe with installing hardware, the sink stopper, and-- with some brand names-- an unique hex wrenchette" that is used both for installing the system and for inserting into a hex hole in the disposer's underside when repair is required to break totally free obstructions.</p>
