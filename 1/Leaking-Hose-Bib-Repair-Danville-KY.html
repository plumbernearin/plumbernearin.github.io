<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe at Danville KY 40422</h3>
<p>If you discover yourself constantly wiggling the flush lever to try to stop your toilet from running, it's time to employ among our licensed Columbus plumbers to help you in finding the leak or broken element and fixing it. Grease: Never ever pour grease, fats, or oils down your kitchen sink. Instead of getting rid of, these materials often harden to form nasty clogs, which you might need a plumber to get rid of.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has altered color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
