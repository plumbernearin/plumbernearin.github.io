<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Elkhorn WI</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
