<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
