<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and associated gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to detect.</p>
