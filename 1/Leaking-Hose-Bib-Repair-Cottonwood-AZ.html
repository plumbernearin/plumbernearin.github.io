<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Cottonwood AZ</h3>

When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
