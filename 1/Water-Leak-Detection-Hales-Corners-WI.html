<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
