<p>Damage control is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I encounter circumstances, on a regular basis that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job.

<p>Call a plumber: If the clog is not in the P-trap and water streams easily from the sink drain into your container, then it's time to call a plumber The clog is most likely even more down the line.
