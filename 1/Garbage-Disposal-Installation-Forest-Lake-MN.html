<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can trigger corrosion that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
