As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there need to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through.

Another idea to stop obstructing is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
