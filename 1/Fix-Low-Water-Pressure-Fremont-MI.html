<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as tough water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
