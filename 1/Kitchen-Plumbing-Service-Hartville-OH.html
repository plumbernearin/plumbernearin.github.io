<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Hartville OH</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to deal with hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
