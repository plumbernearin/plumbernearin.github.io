<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, however avoids it from reversing in the opposite direction. You have irreversible water hardness if you don't see limescale build-up but rather see soap scum, your washing detergents not working as effectively or your skin getting scratchy and sensitive. If you smell gas, do not try to locate the leak. Instead, leave your house or structure right now. Do not turn on or off any electrical switches, devices, or lights, as an electrical charge might develop a trigger. Call the Peoples emergency hotline when you are in a safe place.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the defective pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of years, but steel eventually struggles with rust and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
