No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, and so on.

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
