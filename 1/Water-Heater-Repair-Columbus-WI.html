<p>Gently lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no modification screw.

<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health threat if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
