A toilet's tank is composed of numerous small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their regular use. When these parts wear out, they lead to tiny leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
