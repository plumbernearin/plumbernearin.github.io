<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the general public water supply and private on-site water system and distribution systems by forbiding cross-connections between potable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow techniques offer an increased level of security for the general public water supply system.</p>
<p>Some makers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
