<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide might limit the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
