<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Once installed, these BPAs go through regular and initial testing and maintenance requirements to confirm their continued functional effectiveness. Such testing needs to be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific info is also readily available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Info ).</p>
