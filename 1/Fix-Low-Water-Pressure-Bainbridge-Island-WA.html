<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling.

Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
