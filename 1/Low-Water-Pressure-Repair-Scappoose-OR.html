<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water system line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the main water system system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
