<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
