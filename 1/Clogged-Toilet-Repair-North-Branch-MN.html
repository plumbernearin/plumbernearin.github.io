<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
