Which is why choosing a comfortable, well-made toilet seat is extremely essential. However, you need to make sure your toilet seat really fits your toilet. Most of toilets are standard sized - implying a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, nevertheless, have actually distinctively formed bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem.
