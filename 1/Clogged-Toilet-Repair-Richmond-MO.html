<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the first most obvious signs of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your home. Even if the problem originates with the local system, it's still clever to bring in the professionals to restrict the damage to your home.</p>
<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in studs, joists, and floors. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with a shoddy plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the very best.</p>
