<p>As soon as the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off remains in the closed position.

Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>

Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
