<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate preventative measures.</p>
