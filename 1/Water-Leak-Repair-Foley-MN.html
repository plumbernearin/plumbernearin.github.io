If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
