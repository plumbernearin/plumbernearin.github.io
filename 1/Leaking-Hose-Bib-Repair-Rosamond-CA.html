<p>While repairing your hot water heater is normally the cheaper choice to make, it isn't constantly the best one depending on your circumstance. When you hire Kramer and Sons to work on your water heater, our knowledgeable technicians will go over the pros and cons of replacement vs repair. However, there's still some research you can do before we get here to help speed up the procedure.</p>
<p>The electrical and plumbing work involved in garbage disposal installation make the job potentially hazardous. That makes it a fantastic factor to work with a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal. Homeowners can either buy the new disposal themselves and offer it to the professional for installation, or let the plumber purchase the disposal on their behalf and include it in the total cost.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>We manage all sorts of pluming tasks, from the sturdy exterior setups to basic work on your garbage disposal. We also run a variety of specials from time to time that give you a discount on the quality work that we produce. No job is too small or too big for us, and we take pride in the work we offer our customers. In turn, clients have concerned value our service and have provided radiant evaluations.</p>
