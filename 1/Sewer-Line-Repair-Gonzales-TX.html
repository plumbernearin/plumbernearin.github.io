<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or short-term connection in between a public water system or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. Because they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, typically restore after numerous gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
