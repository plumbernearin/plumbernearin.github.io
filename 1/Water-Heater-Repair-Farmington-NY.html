<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
