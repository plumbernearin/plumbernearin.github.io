<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when utilized in fighting a fire. Firemen by and large are not interested in backflow prevention problems. They are worrying about protecting individuals's lives and to a lesser degree their property.

<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system calculates the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately begins. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
