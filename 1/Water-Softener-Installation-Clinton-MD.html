<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>

<p>Tankless Water Heaters - provide hot water as needed without a tank. The activation of a faucet needing hot water triggers the heater and water is heated up as it streams through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases should never be put down the garbage disposal due to the fact that they can impede the blades. Finally, cold water must be running when the garbage disposal is on and must continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is switched off to guarantee that all food particles have actually been rinsed through the pipes.</p>
