<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the potable system offering the makeup water. This can require the potable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Potential contaminants can then get in the drinkable water system.

This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally taking place gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decomposing of organic matters like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer.
