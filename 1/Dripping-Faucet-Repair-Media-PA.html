Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.
