<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
