Sodium, the mineral that water softeners use to replace solidity ions, likewise has a positive charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other. However, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange happen? There is one other essential aspect required to make the process work: a resin bed including lots of small, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>Water hardness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean.

Finally, a quality contractor will not risk working with a shoddy plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the very best.</p>
