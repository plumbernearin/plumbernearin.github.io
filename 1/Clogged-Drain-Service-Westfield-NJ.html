At Hall's Plumbing, we work with Woodland, CA homeowners whenever they need repiping service or pipe repair.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential clients with recognized backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis. Turn the disposal unit to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that link it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
