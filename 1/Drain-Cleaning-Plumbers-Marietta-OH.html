<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
