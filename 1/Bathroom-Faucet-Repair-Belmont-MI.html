<p>Lots of buildings are closed to the general public or have limited access in order to help slow the spread of COVID-19. To avoid Legionella development, these systems should be actively handled and maintained. See information and guidance to minimize Legionella growth and other pathogen and rust concerns that happen when there is a large drop in structure water use.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. If it has, you most likely have a leak.</p>
<p>The typical toilet will last for years and have very little problems that can be quickly repaired without replacement. However, when it is time for toilet replacement, it is very important to have a licensed and experienced plumber handle the job. At Morrison Plumbing, Heating and Air, we have more than 30 years of experience with toilet installation and toilet replacement. Whether you need a brand-new toilet for a bathroom remodel, moving into a brand-new house, or simply wanting to upgrade your existing toilet, we ensure that our installation process will not damage your home or its plumbing system.</p>
