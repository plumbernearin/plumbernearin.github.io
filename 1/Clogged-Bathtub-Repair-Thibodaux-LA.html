<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive Thibodaux LA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building needs a backflow preventer or numerous devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in extremely unusual cases where the structure is considered to not pose a risk to the water system, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
