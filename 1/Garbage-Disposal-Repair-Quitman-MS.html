<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for a lot of building and construction contractors (or their employees). The secret to the technology is having the ability to control both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby eliminating solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This innovation is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>The typical option is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually suffers from rust and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
