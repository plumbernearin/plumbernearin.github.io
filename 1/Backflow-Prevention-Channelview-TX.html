It truly isn't an excellent idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have actually been particularly created to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or won't disperse your weight equally and could eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
