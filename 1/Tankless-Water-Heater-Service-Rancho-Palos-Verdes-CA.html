<p>It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. First, prepare for each device to be set up must be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which may take up to three weeks or more to process and approve.

<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>It helps to know the brand name and design of your toilet. The brand name is normally on the bowl behind the seat. In many cases, the model or number will be on the underside of the cover or inside the tank. Matching an uncommon flapper can end up being a trial-and-error process. Even professional plumbers often attempt 2 or 3 flappers before they find one that works well.</p>
