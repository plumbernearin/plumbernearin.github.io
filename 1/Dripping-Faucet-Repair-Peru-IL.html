<p>There's an excellent chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This corrosion can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous unfavorable impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Low hot water pressure? Our experienced plumbers can recognize and resolve your low water pressure issue. Indications of deterioration or scale buildup on fixtures may indicate past leaks and high pressure. If there is a bigger problem requiring attention, this can lead plumbers to investigate. Working with gas is very dangerous, and it is necessary to turn off the line to permit a safe repair process.</p>
