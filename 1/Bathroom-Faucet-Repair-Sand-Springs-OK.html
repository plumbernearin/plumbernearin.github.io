<p>E.R. Services understands the value of maintaining the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you notice weird popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this might be an indication that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating element. Lacking hot water rapidly is another sign of sediment build-up, since the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat.
