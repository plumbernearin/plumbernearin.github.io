<p>You need to invest a minimum of $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a long lasting surface and a reliable stopper mechanism. The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can use, however screwing it in and out can be irritating.
