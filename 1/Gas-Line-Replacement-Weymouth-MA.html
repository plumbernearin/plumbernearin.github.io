<p>The typical solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.
