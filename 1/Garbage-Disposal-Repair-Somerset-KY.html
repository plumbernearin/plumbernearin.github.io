<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>If you see moist locations in unexpected parts of your house or discover a drop in water pressure, you may need to replace your plumbing pipes.
