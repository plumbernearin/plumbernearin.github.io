<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building.
