Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
