<p>Before the repair service technician begins the repair process, he needs to make certain he has actually examined the work area around the backflow prevention assembly in order to identify any limiting conditions. If the area is thought about a restricted space, correct security preventative measures need to be followed for correct entry.

This could affect the service technician's ability to successfully finish the repair if the backflow preventer is set up in a restrictive area.</p>
