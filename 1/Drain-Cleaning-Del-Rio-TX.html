<p>Note: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working successfully because difficult water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use more and more cleaning agent to achieve the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and sanitized throughout regeneration. Finally, water consisting of the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
