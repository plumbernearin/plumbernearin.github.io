When you water heater is not working correctly, it might be because of any variety of repair or maintenance problems. In most cases it is a basic fix and does not require a new warm water heater.

<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can take place with time from the accumulation of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes. As a clog becomes bigger in time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining effectively.
