<p>If you've always resided in an area with hard water, you may not understand how much it affects you-- however if you have actually just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too aware of the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Difficult water interferes with the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Difficult water likewise makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>
<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can take place with time from the buildup of hair, littles soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes. As a clog becomes bigger over time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes properly. You can fight difficult water in various ways, consisting of filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, including a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
