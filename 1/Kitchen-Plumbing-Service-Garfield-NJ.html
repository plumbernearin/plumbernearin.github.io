<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
