<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or purchase one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Unforeseen modifications in water pressure might possibly be because of rust and buildup within the pipes themselves, which narrow the passage that water can move through. You'll most likely notice lower water pressure in the shower or when washing meals. The best solution is to replace your plumbing with new pipes that do not have accumulation.</p>
