Food washed down a drain mistakenly or on purpose without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, causing obstructions and slowly damaging your plumbing system. Tiny food particles created by a waste disposal unit wash directly down quickly.</p>
<p>If the sound of your toilet continuously running is normal to you, then you've got a problem with over-running or leaking. This water is being discarded down the overflow tube wasting approximately 200 gallons of water per day. That takes a toll on your water expense, not to discuss the risk of a more severe leak that might wreak havoc on your home with flooding.</p>
