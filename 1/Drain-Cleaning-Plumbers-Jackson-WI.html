Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on.
