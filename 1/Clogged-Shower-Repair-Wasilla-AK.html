<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Central Ohio Gas Line Services LLC specializes in the installation and repair of residential and commercial gas and propane gas lines, water service lines, gas line troubleshooting and consultation services.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water system line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the primary water system system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
