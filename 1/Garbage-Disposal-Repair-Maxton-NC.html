<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
