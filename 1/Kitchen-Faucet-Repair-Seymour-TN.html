High energy bills? It may be time for a new hot water heater. But in order to profit of a new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it set up properly.

<p>Depending upon your scenario, your plumber might use one or a mix of piping product during your house repiping job. Copper is standard because it's lasting, can endure fires, and withstands weather. Nevertheless, copper is tough to install, which suggests higher labor costs.

Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
