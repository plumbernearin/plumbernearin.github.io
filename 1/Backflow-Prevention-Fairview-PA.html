The minerals that trigger difficult water stick to the beads, and the cured water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Outdoor plumbing for leakages or blockages. After inspecting everything inside your home, your pro will then inspect the outdoor plumbing. If you live an area where temperatures go below freezing, he or she will make certain pipes have anti-freeze protection in place. More convenient property owners may want to tackle garbage disposal problems by themselves.
