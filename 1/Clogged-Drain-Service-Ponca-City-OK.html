If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation.

To prevent this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation set consists of a tube, or buy one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
