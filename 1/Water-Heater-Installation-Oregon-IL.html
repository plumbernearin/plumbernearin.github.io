<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Contractor in Oregon</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to save money. While this might work in the short-term, remember that the weakened pipe is made from the same product as other pipes in your home, meaning that difficulty might be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you comfort and avoid larger leakages down the road.</p>
