<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
