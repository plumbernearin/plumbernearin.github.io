<p>It can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less easily when water is hard. Water softening can prevent these unfavorable impacts. Natural gas is a colorless, odor free fuel. As a security preventative measure, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that provides natural gas a smell typically associated with rotten eggs. This distinctive scent permits you to smell a possible leak if it occurs. If you presume a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>The most common technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, generally sodium. Sodium won't cause lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds just a really small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered very low salt" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
