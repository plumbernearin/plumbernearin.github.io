Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
