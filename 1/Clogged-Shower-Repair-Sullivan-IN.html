<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
