<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Company in Rustburg</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>House owners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is especially sensible to organize inspections on a yearly basis and when acquiring a brand-new home. Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the baking soda and vinegar mixture, an enzyme treatment will also keep pipes running smoothly. Enzymes are germs that feed on organic matter, such as hair, mold, algae and other typical clog-causers. This all-natural service is safe and effective. Contact us today at High 5 Plumbing to acquire our suggested enzyme cleaner, Bioclean.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification. I have actually checked with a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
