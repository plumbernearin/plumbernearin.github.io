<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. The service technician shut off the water supply and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to get rid of the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture. The client assisted our technician in moving the toilet back into its proper place, and the professional tightened the bolts prior to bring back the water system and ensuring that the toilet was properly flushing.</p>

<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
