<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
