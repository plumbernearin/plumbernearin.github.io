<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Annapolis MD</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>It's a good concept to schedule yearly inspections if your plumbing system is years old and if you know that you have a history of leaking or clogging. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Approved Tester List to test the backflow assembly. The tester will send the results to us.
