As soon as the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
