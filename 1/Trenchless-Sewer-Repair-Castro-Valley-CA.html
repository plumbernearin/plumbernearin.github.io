<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction. You have permanent water hardness if you do not see limescale build-up but rather see soap residue, your washing cleaning agents not working as efficiently or your skin getting scratchy and sensitive. If you smell gas, do not try to find the leak. Instead, leave your house or building right away. Do not switch on or off any electrical switches, appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge could produce a spark. When you are in a safe place, call the Peoples emergency hotline.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to carry out site inspections to figure out if a backflow prevention device is needed as an outcome of a actual or prospective  cross-connection hazard on a consumer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections located on Vashon Island are just performed on Wednesdays.

A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure needs a backflow preventer or numerous devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in very rare cases where the building is considered to not posture a danger to the water system, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
