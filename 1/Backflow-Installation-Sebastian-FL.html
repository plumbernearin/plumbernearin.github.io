<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and then return to service. Since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such models are hassle-free.</p>
