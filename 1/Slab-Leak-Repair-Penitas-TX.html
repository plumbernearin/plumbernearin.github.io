<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a practical solution, specifically when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your house and family.</p>
