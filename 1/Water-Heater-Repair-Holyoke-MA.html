<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
