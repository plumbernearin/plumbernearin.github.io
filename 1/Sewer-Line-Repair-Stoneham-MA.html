<h3>Tips For Finding An Emergency Plumber Stoneham MA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure requires a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in extremely rare cases where the building is considered to not posture a risk to the water supply, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
<p>To make it easy, property owners with testable backflow gadgets are expected to have them evaluated by a certified tester annually. The most common testable backflow device found at Minnesota homes is a pressure vacuum breaker, which is a device that is discovered on nearly every residential lawn watering system (aka sprinkler system), shown below.</p>
