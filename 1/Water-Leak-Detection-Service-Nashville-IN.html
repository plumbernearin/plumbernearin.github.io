<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and obligation are incredibly important to constructing a track record for quality. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the potable supply of water within a structure these devices are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to offer one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
