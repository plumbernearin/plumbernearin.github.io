<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing installed during building of a brand-new or renovated building is set up by knowledgeable artisans in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or pour flat soda in your sink, you generally understand your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

I've contacted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
