<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
