Water softening is accomplished with SACr by using exclusive polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads speed up the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to entirely eliminate temporary solidity in water.</p>

You might smell the revolting odor of sewage before you feel the squish of your yard under your feet (ideally shoed feet!).

Plumbers refer to a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's contact number is on your speed dial.</p>
