<p>When used in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a problem. Firemen by and large are not worried about backflow prevention issues. They are concerning with securing people's lives and to a lower extent their residential or commercial property. Getting the essential volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will utilize water from any source offered to accomplish that objective. This can produce cross-connection control problems and may as a result indicate that the level of defense on the fire defense system may need to be increased to a high danger security level.</p>
<p>If you discover low water pressure or discolored water, it typically signifies rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop gradually, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you may see lower water pressure. The staining occurs when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your supply of water, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can end up being a health risk in your water.</p>
