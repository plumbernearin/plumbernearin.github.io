I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it also.</p>

It may not work very well all the time, but you can't tell if that's regular or not. Plus, there's that never unacknowledged but omnipresent sensation that it's you-you're in some way doing something incorrect therein.</p>
