When shopping for a brand-new flapper, your best choice is to try and find the exact same flapper that originally came with your existing flush valve.

If you don't know your model number, however, we do use a substantial selection of "will fit" flappers to help you out. See the video listed below to find out more about the different sort of flappers offered, or check out How To Replace Toilet Flappers for brief tutorials on altering toilet flappers, tank balls, and flush valve seals.</p>
