<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see but seldom stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck.

At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

While this might work in the short term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the same material as other pipes in your house, implying that difficulty might be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you assurance and avoid larger leaks down the roadway.</p>
