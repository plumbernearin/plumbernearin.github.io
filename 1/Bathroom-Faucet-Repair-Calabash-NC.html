<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there must be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
