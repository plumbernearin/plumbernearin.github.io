<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient operating a need more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process.

Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
