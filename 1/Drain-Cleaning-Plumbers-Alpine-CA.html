<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are seriously harmed, for changing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root invasion for up to 100 years.</p>
