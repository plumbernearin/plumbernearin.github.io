You, therefore, have to use increasingly more cleaning agent to accomplish the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and disinfected throughout regeneration. Lastly, water containing the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
