The only function of salt in a water softener is to regenerate the resin beads that take the hardness out of water.</p>
<p>Through experience we understand that a lot of softener resins and ion exchanger resins last about twenty to twenty-five years. Need a toilet bowl replacement? We can handle that, too.

<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working successfully because difficult water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use increasingly more cleaning agent to accomplish the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and disinfected throughout regeneration. Lastly, water containing the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
