If your kit just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.

<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair service technician knows the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation.
