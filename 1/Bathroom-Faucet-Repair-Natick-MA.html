<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Natick MA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
