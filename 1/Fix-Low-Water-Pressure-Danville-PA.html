<p>The heating element is taking longer to heat up the water than it should if the water feels warm. However this particular problem is when you have no hot water flowing in your home. The factors for this can vary from leaks, defective or malfunctioning electrical circuitry, or a broken heating component or thermostat. If it is one of the pointed out problems, a repair or replacement of the components may be adequate. However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems occurring frequently, then a water heater replacement is required.</p>

This is so that it can bring in the irons that would typically trigger rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately end up being worn and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your hot water heater extremely quickly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
