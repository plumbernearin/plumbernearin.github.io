<p>It can take a number of weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be completed. Initially, plans for each device to be installed must be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which might use up to three weeks or more to approve and process.

<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

Call the manufacturer to see whether your guarantee covers a complimentary replacement if you need to replace the sink or faucet.</p>
