<p>When per year to clean out the drains and keep whatever running smoothly, we recommend that homeowners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least. It's also helpful since, at the same time, the plumber can expect the drains and recommend any drain repair, or drain cleaning service. In some cases whatever is obstructing the drain will not budge.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing homeowner wish to get their hands dirty with. It requires more than simply effort to fix broken sewer systems, and the problem is typically due to how frustrating it is to assess the damage. This is a lot more problematic if the damage is irreversible or requires more extensive repair, especially in commercial settings.</p>
