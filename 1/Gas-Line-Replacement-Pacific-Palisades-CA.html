<p>Trenchless Sewer Replacement Experts: If you have actually had a sewer or drain back-up, possibilities are it's not the first and won't be the last. Multiple back-ups normally indicate your sewage system is stopping working. We suggest following up with a complete video inspection of the entire system to identify what is causing the problem and to determine whether it will be a recurring concern.

<p>Use the convenient self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Several houses in my area being repiped and have actually spoken with next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Obviously it starts with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can cause major damage if the leak isn't spotted soon.</p>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line clogs are not something a property owner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain technician to use a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this type of camera to identify and repair the drain problem. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is especially useful in locating an issue.</p>
