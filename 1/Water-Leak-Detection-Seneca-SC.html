<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
