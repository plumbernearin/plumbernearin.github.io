Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions.

<p>It prevails for hot water heater to leak due to fluctuating pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve belongs to the system for that precise factor.

I will use Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>
