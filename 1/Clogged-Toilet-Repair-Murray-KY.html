It is extremely hard to evaluate such claims, which are almost never based upon tests that are well adequate described to permit others to evaluate them and to validate the outcomes. While the absence of "scientific" proof does not in itself invalidate a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it needs to make one hesitate to accept it without some guarantee of performance.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
