<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to spot.</p>
<p>Your storm drains don't go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is usually directed somewhere else to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, or perhaps the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat areas of pipe that can be vulnerable to clogging due to the fact that there simply isn't enough a high enough flow to flush out the debris.</p>

Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
