<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to lots of carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
