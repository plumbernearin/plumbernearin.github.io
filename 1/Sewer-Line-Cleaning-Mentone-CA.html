<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally kept at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
