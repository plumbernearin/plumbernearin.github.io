<p>Backpressure may take place when the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not properly protected, safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the wallet of a house owner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum standards for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department need to satisfy or exceed the state standards and carry the obligation for enforcing them.</p>
