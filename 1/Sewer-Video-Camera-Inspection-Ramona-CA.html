An authorized backflow prevention device, which need to be evaluated yearly, need to be set up on the service connection that the department has actually determined as having a potential for backflow.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets should definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
