It depends on point of view, and what you as a private feel are the conveniences you and your family need many.</p>

<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your yard. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
