<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I have actually consulted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>The most efficient way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Sinks aren't as simple as they utilized to be. Nowadays, homeowners can select from an excessive range of sinks for the kitchen, bath, wet bar, energy room, and more.
