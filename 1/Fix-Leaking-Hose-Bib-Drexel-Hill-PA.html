<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal proof that certain magnetic and electromagnetic gadgets can be efficient in avoiding scale development in difficult water systems. It is extremely difficult to evaluate such claims, which are almost never based upon tests that are well adequate described to enable others to evaluate them and to verify the results. While the absence of "scientific" proof does not in itself invalidate a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it needs to make one think twice to accept it without some assurance of performance.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that of the fundamental design of a decreased pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an exceptionally low circulation or static circulation condition may trigger annoyance dripping and possible fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will frequently hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.</p>
