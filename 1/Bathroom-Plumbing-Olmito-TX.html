<p>Do not put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is necessary to watch what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and potentially cause a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also cause jams and blockages - think about composting or positioning these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can harden and collect in your drain also. After completing cooking, think about putting leftover grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>

<p>5. Put warm water down your drain after using the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, rinse your drain with a bit of hot water. Whether tree roots have actually made their method into your pipes or you flushed something you should not have, a clogged toilet is never a pleasant experience. Fortunately, you do not constantly need the help of a professional to fix it.</p>
<p>Numerous plumbing concerns involve stoppages and clogged drains or pipes.
