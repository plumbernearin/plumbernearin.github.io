<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the part, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities.
