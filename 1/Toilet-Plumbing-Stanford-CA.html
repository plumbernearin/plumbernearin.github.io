<p>Due to the fact that it can spread infected water back through a distribution system, Backflow is a prospective issue in a water system. For example, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any possible or actual connection in between the general public water supply and a source of contamination or pollution) can allow pollutants or pollutants to enter the drinkable water system.
