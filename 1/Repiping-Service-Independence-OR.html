<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Independence OR</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under your house is simply the cost to install a new plumbing system which can range from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per direct foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under houses, often times in concrete. It is quite common to leave the old pipes in place after disconnecting them. The brand-new pipe is simply set up in the course of least resistance.
