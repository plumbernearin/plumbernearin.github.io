This innovation is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position.
