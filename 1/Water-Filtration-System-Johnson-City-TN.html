If your system is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the brand-new system in.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
