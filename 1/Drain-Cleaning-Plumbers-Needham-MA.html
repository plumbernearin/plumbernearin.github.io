<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
