<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers are a reasonably simple system, regardless of their value. Most of commercial use backflow prevention setups use a valve system that connects with the watering line within your company, where watering meets the main water supply.

This makes sure that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other watering and wastewater systems remains disconnected from clean" water.</p>
