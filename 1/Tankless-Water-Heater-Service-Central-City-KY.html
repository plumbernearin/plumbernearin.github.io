<p>Is your house 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary product used in plumbing.

<h3>Sump Pump Replacement in Central City Kentucky</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
