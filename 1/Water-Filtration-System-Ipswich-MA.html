When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, clay, copper or plastic, will determine the degree of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>There are numerous causes for blockages depending on where they take place in your plumbing Toilets clog from excessive toilet paper for the many part. When the toilet tissue collects in the sewer pipe leading from the toilet rather of streaming through it, the toilet will not flush. The water just back up in the bowl.
