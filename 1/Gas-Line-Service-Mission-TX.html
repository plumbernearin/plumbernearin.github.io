<p>If the toilet can not be fixed, or if the repair cost approaches replacement cost, we'll discuss your alternatives. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular approach of clearing blockages.

<p>Many toilet problems, including leaking toilets, don't demand repairing the whole toilet.

Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear out and trigger toilet leaks that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
