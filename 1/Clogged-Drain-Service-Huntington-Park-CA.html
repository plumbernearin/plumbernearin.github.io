<p>Agilent's series of leak detection solutions make sure the security, security and constant performance of research, vacuum, and industrial process systems. Checking the water meter is a great next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and examine if the water meter is turning. There is a leak somewhere and this could be severe problem if it is. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your home should have water.
