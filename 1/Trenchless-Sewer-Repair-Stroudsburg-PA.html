<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>The sewer camera inspection permits you to really see the interior condition of the drain line. It also lets you see the product the drain line is made from. You can tell if the issue with your drain line remains in a particular place, or if the whole line or a part of the sewer line needs changing. If there is a break in the line, the camera not just confirms the area of the break but allows you to see the nature of the break, also. When preparing to connect another sewer into the line, a camera can also be utilized to visually examine the condition of a sewer line. It can also be used for pre-house sales or whenever the need occurs to confirm that a sewer is in great condition.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
