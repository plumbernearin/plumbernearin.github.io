<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Deland FL 32724</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
