<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to blockages with food and grease being the significant culprits. If fats are poured down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls too. Even tree roots can develop serious drain obstructions by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to find and repair the problem for typical house plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned up before it leads to more damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
