<p>Renovation plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this technique, you know the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>There are health and safety threats one should prevent while working on a sewer line task. Methane gas, salmonella, e. coli, giardia - all are found in sewer pipes and may expose workers during the sewer repair procedure. If your Do It Yourself dig hits a natural gas line, breathing the gas can damage your body, and there is a danger of fire or explosion damage to your residential or commercial property or your neighbor's. Another risk in sewer repair tasks is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig website. Your security and health are too crucial to risk in a DIY sewer project! Avoid these security hazards by working with a professional plumber.</p>
