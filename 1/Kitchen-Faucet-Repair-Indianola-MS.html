    <title>Kitchen Faucet Repair Indianola MS</title>
    <meta name="description" content="24 Hours Plumbing Company Indianola Mississippi - Our faucet came with hot and cold water lines, and we got the silencing kit with our SHURFLO water pump, so we already had most of the components we needed for our very simple plumbing set up. The only complicated part was splitting the output from the pump to go to both the cold water line straight to the faucet and to the water heater before it went to the hot water line of the faucet.">
