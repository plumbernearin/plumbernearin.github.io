<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
