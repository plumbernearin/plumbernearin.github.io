<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; extra, more significant costs can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for citizens. A PE or RA can help determine if installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
