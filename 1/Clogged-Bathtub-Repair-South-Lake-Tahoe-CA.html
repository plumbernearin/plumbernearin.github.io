<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can trigger corrosion that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and eliminates from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>

While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
