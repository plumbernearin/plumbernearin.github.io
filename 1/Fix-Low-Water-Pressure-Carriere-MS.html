<p>Do not put whatever down your garbage disposal. It is very important to view what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and potentially cause a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also trigger jams and obstructions - consider composting or positioning these items in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can collect and congeal in your drain also. After completing cooking, consider pouring leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then reheat and utilize for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>

<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
