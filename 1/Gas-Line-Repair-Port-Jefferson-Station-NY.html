<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building requires a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in extremely unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not position a danger to the supply of water, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
