<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leakages under the sink to validate that your plumber's putty is making a good seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and enable the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Look for leakages and tighten as needed. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cords as wanted.</p>
<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a residence is since there is too much hair in the shower drain.
