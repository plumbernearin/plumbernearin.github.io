<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for most building contractors (or their staff members). The key to the innovation is being able to manage both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, consequently removing hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates service technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your residential or commercial property.

The information we obtain from the inspection allows us to make a notified choice regarding the condition of your pipes and recommend the very best solution as well.
