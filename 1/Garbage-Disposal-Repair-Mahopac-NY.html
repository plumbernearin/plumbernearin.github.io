<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair cracked pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily usage must not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the unit in a steady and safe place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth, you must wait till after the cycle is completed and after that inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings.

A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
