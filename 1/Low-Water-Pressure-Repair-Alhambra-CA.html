Compared to the day-to-day costs and frustrations sustained by hard water, a water softener is ultimately an investment that will save you a substantial quantity of cash.

<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less easily. Water softening can avoid these negative effects. Gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a safety precaution, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives gas a smell often connected with rotten eggs. This unique aroma allows you to smell a prospective leak if it occurs. Constantly leave if you presume a leak.</p>
