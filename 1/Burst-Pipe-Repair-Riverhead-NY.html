<p>If you think your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it does not always require a repair of your whole unit. A toilet's tank is composed of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their regular use. When these parts break, they lead to small leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as soon as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets should absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet needs to be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>
