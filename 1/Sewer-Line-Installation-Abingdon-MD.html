It's so old that it is no longer able to press water through the toilet to completely clear the drain. This leads to your toilet having a constant clogging issue.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the many part, a waste disposal unit is just geared up to manage softer organic waste.

Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
