<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
