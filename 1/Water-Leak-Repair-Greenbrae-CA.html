<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place.

Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
