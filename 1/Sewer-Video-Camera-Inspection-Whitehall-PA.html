<p>It's a great concept to have a professional assess your drain system if you experience clogs and backups in your home more than a couple of times. A drain expert like TLC will utilize a camera to examine your drain system.

<p>The excellent news is that it does not always need a repair of your entire unit if you presume your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is made up of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear, they result in tiny leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
