<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there must be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you need to probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
