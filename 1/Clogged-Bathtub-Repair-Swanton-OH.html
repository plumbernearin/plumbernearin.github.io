<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct result on your safety, convenience, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. Diane Heether is a city citizen of Belding and she is grateful for having a water softener installed in her house. It didn't simply make and enhance cleaning easier, but it helps minimize waste also. A backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve arrangement created to prevent the reversal of the circulation of water once it has actually passed through the valve.
