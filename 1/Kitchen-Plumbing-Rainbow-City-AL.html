<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water supply exceeds the pressure in the safe and clean system providing the makeup water. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Possible pollutants can then go into the potable water system. The best way to decrease accumulation is have a professional flush it at least when a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral material, you may need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Inspection Department is responsible for protecting the water supply by guaranteeing, through strategy evaluation and inspections, that the plumbing has no cross-connections or possibility of backflow. The plumbing inspectors are likewise responsible for ensuring the waste plumbing is appropriately vented and trapped so the plumbing securely carries waste away while causing no health problems.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
