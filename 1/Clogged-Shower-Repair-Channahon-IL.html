When faucet and sink problems require replacement, our plumbers have a wide choice of faucet replacements right on their truck, typically getting rid of a follow-up service call and getting your plumbing issue resolved on the area.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers readily available that you might run into. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check".
