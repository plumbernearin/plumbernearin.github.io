<p>Backpressure may occur when the potable supply piping is connected to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not properly safeguarded, non-potable and potable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system.</p>
