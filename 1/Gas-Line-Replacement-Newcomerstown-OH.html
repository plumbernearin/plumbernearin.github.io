The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment industry, has not been able to determine requirements for these products and report inconsistent performance to date. Research study has revealed no change happens in the chemical and physical homes or the calcium ion concentration of water treated with the devices (The Water Quality Association Magnetics Task Force, 2001).</p>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
