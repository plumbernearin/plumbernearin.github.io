<p>A camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your lawn. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.

<p>Pieces that comprise kitchen sink drains can become used and corroded, leading to leakages. Depending upon the seriousness of the situation, only one piece may need replacement, or the whole under-sink assembly needs to be removed and changed.
