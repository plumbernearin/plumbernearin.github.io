Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
