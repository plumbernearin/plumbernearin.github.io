<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair specialist understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>While you can fix some toilet problems yourself, many are tough or indicate more complicated problems than what you see on the surface area. DIY toilet repairs are not the very best choice if you have an older toilet, a leak, or a possible problem with your pipes. You might unconsciously worsen a pipe issue if you have to consistently plunge a toilet. There are a lot of things that can fail with Do It Yourself and quick fixes. It's always best to hire a professional plumber for toilet repairs and replacements.</p>
