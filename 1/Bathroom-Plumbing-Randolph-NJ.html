<p>Old, used, or damaged plumbing pipes can trigger considerable problems. Even small leakages can gradually moisten walls and floors till they become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other irritants.

Possibilities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger might not suffice to resolve this concern. Call a plumber right away.</p>

That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that streams through the softener.
