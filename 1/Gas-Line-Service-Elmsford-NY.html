<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the offender. But not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean.

When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately begins. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
