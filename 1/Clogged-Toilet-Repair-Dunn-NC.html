<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing cleaning agent from working successfully due to the fact that tough water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use more and more detergent to attain the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and disinfected during regrowth. Finally, water including the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
