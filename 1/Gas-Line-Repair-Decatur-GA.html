<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Decatur GA</h3>
<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had great evaluations and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it also.</p>
<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, known as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them functioning effectively. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality. If a repipe in Brenham is ideal for you, call today at (979) 200-6674 to have your plumbing checked and we will let you understand.</p>
